The network you know and love will simply be referred to as Ethereum.",

  "page-upgrades-question-10-answer-5": "Phase 1 originally focused on implementing the shard chains, but prioritization has shifted to 'the merge' which is the next planned upgrade.",
  "page-upgrades-question-10-answer-6": "Phase 1.5 was originally planned to follow shard implementations, when Mainnet would be added as the last shard to the Beacon Chain. To expedite the transition away from proof-of-work mining, Mainnet will instead represent the first shard to connect with the Beacon Chain. This is now known as 'the merge' and will be a significant step towards a greener Ethereum.",
  "page-upgrades-question-10-answer-7": "Though the plans around Phase 2 have been a point of intense research and discussion, with the merge planned before shard chains, this will allow for continued reassessment as to the needs of Ethereum development moving forward.
