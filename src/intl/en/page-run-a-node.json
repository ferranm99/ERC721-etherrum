  "page-run-a-node-censorship-resistance-1": "Don't be censored. Having your own node to submit a transaction to guarantees that you can broadcast your transaction to the rest of the network. A public node could choose to block transactions from specific IP or account addresses, potentially blocking someone from using the network when needed.",
  "page-run-a-node-decentralized-title": "Decentralized",
  "page-run-a-node-decentralized-1": "Centralized cloud servers can provide a lot of computer power, but they provide a target for nation-states or attackers looking to disrupt the network.",
  "page-run-a-node-decentralized-2": "More nodes, in more places, operated by more diverse people, means a more resilient network. As more people run their own node, reliance on centralized points-of-failure diminishes, making the network stronger.",

  "page-run-a-node-security-and-privacy-1": "Every transaction is verified locally on your own machine. If a malicious node distributes an invalid transaction, your node will simply disregard it.",

  "page-run-a-node-sovereignty-1": "Think of running a node like the next step beyond getting your own Ethereum wallet.",
  "page-run-a-node-sovereignty-2": "An Ethereum wallet allows you to take full custody and control of your digital assets by holding the private keys to your address, but those keys don't tell you the current state of the blockchain, such as your wallet balance.",
  "page-run-a-node-sovereignty-3": "By default, Ethereum wallets typically reach out to a public node when looking up your balances. Running your own node allows you to have your own copy of the Ethereum blockchain.",

  "page-run-a-node-what-does-it-mean-1": "Running an Ethereum node may sound complicated, but it's merely the act of continuously running software on a computer that is connected to the internet.",
  "page-run-a-node-what-does-it-mean-2": "The software (known as a \"client\") receives new transactions and blocks, verifies their validity based on a predetermined set of consensus rules, rejects anything invalid, and propagates valid transactions and blocks to other nodes.",
  "page-run-a-node-what-does-it-mean-3": "Ethereum is designed to be able to operate node software on average consumer grade computers. These clients can be run from any personal computer (with minimal specs and some grasp of the command-line), but many users instead opt to run this software on dedicated hardware to eliminate the impact on their personal computer, and to minimize node downtime.",
