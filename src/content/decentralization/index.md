## What's decentralization? {#what-is-decentralization}

Decentralized systems are everywhere. They're in nature, finance, architecture, art, communications, government, and — you guessed it — computer science.

In a decentralized system no individual or group makes decisions unilaterally. In basic terms: nobody is in charge, but things still work. Rules without rulers.

If this sounds familiar, it should. Apart from the fact that there are tons of examples, decentralization-to-centralization is a spectrum. Many systems have some aspect of both.

### Basic example of decentralization {#decentralization-example}

Decentralization exists on a spectrum. There are also different types of decentralization.

The Ethereum network is one example. It's built to succeed without centralized control or central points of failure.

Ethereum operates according to rules set out in the protocol (rules that no single person or organization has the authority to change). A widespread, diverse collective of individuals and groups run the software on their own computers, powering the network. Anyone can participate.

Compare this to a centralized cloud service — you should see the difference immediately. The service provider decides who gets to use the service, dictates prices, and chooses where the hardware is located.

### Common aspects of decentralized systems {#elements-of-decentralization}

There are many ways to define decentralization. If you're trying to determine how decentralized something is, look for the following attributes:

- **Resistant to censorship**: Not able to unilaterally control what gets published.
- **High security**: Open systems are built to resist inevitable bad actors.
- **Permissionless participation**: Very basic criteria for participation, often outside of the control of the system (i.e. access to an internet connection).
- **Pseudonymity or anonymity**: Participants in the system can usually interact without exposing their identities.
- **Community control**: The people who use, operate, and maintain the system all have significant input.
- **Rules that everyone can see**: Everyone can audit the system (open source). People can copy the rules, modify them, and start new systems (free).
- **Deterministic**: The rules produce the same outcome given the same input.
- **Public records**: A history of how the system has operated is held by multiple participants.

## Why is decentralization important? {#why-decentralize}

Centralized systems can be useful and beneficial. Unfortunately, they are prone to some serious risks:

- Governance risk (corporate leadership teams might unilaterally make poor decisions)
- Technical failure (it's more likely for small engineering mistakes to create big problems)
- Economically feasible attacks (fewer targets generally cost less to attack)
- The powerful conspiring against the less-powerful (those in control of centralized systems can engage in censorship, exploitation, monopolies)

The international economic crisis in 2008 resulted from systematic exploitation and poor decision-making. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Bitcoin gained popularity in the aftermath as a decentralized alternative to traditional assets.

Decentralized systems reduce or eliminate many of the risks inherent in centralized ones. It depends on the exact architecture, but here are some examples of how:

- **Diversity**: Including diverse members and structural elements that (collectively) are unlikely to fail.
- **Dispersion**: Eliminating single points of failure and therefore increasing the cost of attacks.
- **Mutuality**: Exploitation of other participants results in losses for the exploiter.
- **Distribution**: Making it difficult to obtain unilateral control of resources or undue influence on important decisions.
- **Integrity**: Building networks of people who work towards principles of decentralization (as opposed to a network of people who, say, buy a large amount of a single currency when it is worth almost nothing and then proceed to exaggerate the benefits of their choice while bashing all other projects).
- **Resistance**: Making unwanted behaviors impossible (as opposed to mitigating resulting losses or punishing people).

## Trust and consequences {#trust-in-decentralization}

We put a huge amount of trust in centralized financial institutions. However, as [history has repeatedly shown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_banking_crises), our confidence is not always well-placed.

### What's going on behind the scenes? {#opacity}

Centralized institutions often display an opaque, easy-to-understand set of services to the public. Savings accounts, payment processing, and retail investment accounts are a few examples. A lot of complex things go on behind the scenes that you might not be aware of:

- Banks loan your money to other clients
- International payment processors make money in foreign exchange markets
- Exchanges/brokers give special deals to market-makers (some of whom might borrow money from you, directly or indirectly)

Centralized institutions and systems might be trustworthy, and they might not be. There is often simply no way of knowing.

You might not care what these institutions are doing as long as you get the services you want. That's fine, and you're probably in the majority. The problem is that, should you ever start to care, there's no way to see what's going on behind the scenes.

### Transparency {#transparency}

In Ethereum, these opaque intermediaries do not exist. Instead, you need to trust three things:

- The network
- The operations running on it
- The people on the other end of your transaction, in some cases

### The role of trust on Ethereum {#trust-ethereum}

Let's look at an example. Say you want to send people some ETH.

You need to trust that the network operators will continue to run their machines. You need to trust that the software will continue working. Finally, if the recipients are sending you something in exchange, you need to trust that they will fulfill their promise. You _don't_ need to trust anyone to send the money. The network takes care of that provably and predictably.

That's just a simple example. Ethereum does much, much more than sending money from one person to another.

There are various types of smart contracts (blockchain computer programs) operating on Ethereum. These smart contracts automate many traditional financial services, such as escrow accounts, auctions, marketplaces, exchanges, and so on. The best part: You can do it all without the need to trust a human intermediary.

Ethereum is a trustless network. This means that, for reasons we just went through, there is no counterparty risk: no third parties that could violate your contract.

It's trustless not because we don't trust it — but because we don't have to. You can look at any aspect of it and predict the outcome of any action you plan to take. You can investigate the transaction history, the machine architecture, the consensus algorithm, smart contract code, client software, etc.

In this trustless system, you can choose who and what to trust based on logic. In other words, you can unequivocally prove that a process is trustworthy.

Can your centralized bank make the same claim to trustworthiness? Let's say you wanted to prove that your bank had enough money to cover a withdrawal. You would need to obtain something that Ethereum provides by default: a full, open record of every transaction ever executed.

## Decentralization is everywhere {#decentralized-world}

Decentralization is nothing new. You can find it everywhere from ant colonies to blockchain projects.

Peer-to-peer systems are a classic internet example. In P2P, users double as servers, both providing and using resources. These protocols are decentralized — there's nobody in between controlling.

Examples of P2P protocols include BitTorrent and Skype. Additionally, many basic internet functions happen within a decentralized framework called [end-to-end networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_principle).

A nightclub dance floor is an offline example of decentralized organization. People manage to accomplish the task at hand without anyone dictating how to dance. They automatically act appropriately — in a rapidly changing environment (music changing) and under considerable resource constraints (limited floor space).

## Decentralization in Ethereum {#ethereum-decentralized}

First things first: Nobody owns Ethereum. The [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.foundation) provides support, but so do tons of other individuals and organizations.

Building on that, Ethereum is decentralized in many other important ways. People operate nodes across the world, there are many different client software options, and it interoperates (often via third-party [decentralized apps](https://ethereum.org/en/dapps/), or dapps) with a lot of other decentralized protocols. The Ethereum network is built to resist spammers, provide clear consensus, and render attacks economically nonviable.

Ethereum is also _centralized_ in a very important way — there is an agreed-upon set of rules (in the form of computer code) that every node should follow. This allows the system to operate predictably. However, it bears mentioning that these rules are upgraded and maintained in a decentralized way.

### Smart contracts {#smart-contracts}

This logical centralization (the agreed mode of operation) allows the [Ethereum Virtual Machine](https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/#evm) to run smart contracts reliably. Smart contracts are computer programs that run on the EVM. They're essential parts of any Ethereum dapp. They provide the backbone for exchanges, escrow services, NFTs, and nearly anything else you can imagine.

Many dapps have a nice front-end user interface these days — a mobile app or a website, for example. However, some of those front-ends run on centralized servers or are served on centralized cloud companies.

The strength of smart contracts is that they keep running even if the servers hosting front-end portals go down. If the dapp you want to use has open-source code, you (or someone who knows how to do this) could potentially download the front-end and host your own instance on your own servers. The same goes for writing programs that interact with the smart contract. As long as Ethereum is working, it's likely most of the services will be available.

This level of resilience and resistance to attack is possible because of decentralization. Ethereum keeps running (and so do its smart contracts) even if there is a massive cloud provider outage, widespread censorship, or something else that breaks the popular user interface.

## Pros and cons of using Ethereum {#pros-cons}

Decentralization has a number of pros and cons, but they're mostly dependent on exact use cases. To make things more straightforward, let's use Ethereum as an example.

You'll notice that most of the cons of Ethereum come from it being a new technology, not from it being decentralized. New technologies are hard to use for one simple reason: You don't know how to use them yet.

Conversely, most of the pro-Ethereum arguments come directly from the fact that the network is decentralized. Your traditional financial institutions are unlikely to offer these benefits. In some cases, they simply can't.

### Pros {#pros-of-ethereum}

- You have control over your funds.
- It would take a complex, coordinated, international attack of disproportionate cost to stop the Ethereum network from operating.
- You don't need permission to participate (no loan applications, for example). All you need is access to the network.
- Ethereum does not associate your activities with your personal identity (because it doesn't know who you are).
- Brute-force "identity theft" crimes can be extremely difficult because account credentials are cryptographically protected.
- You can issue transactions instantly from anywhere with an internet connection.
- You can check how everything works — and even participate directly in improving it.

### Cons {#cons-of-ethereum}

- Nobody but the recipient can help if you send your funds to the wrong address.
- You are responsible for account security and privacy practices: for keeping your [private keys](https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/#private-key) secure and keeping your personal information separate from your online activities.
- You will probably have to learn new information and behaviors.
- It is your responsibility to identify and comply with applicable laws.
- It can be difficult to know which contracts, information sources, and apps you should trust.

It basically comes down to whether controlling your money is worth your attention — whether obtaining a higher degree of freedom is worth learning something new. In the end, it's up to you to decide.

### A system under active development {#progress-ethereum}

However, know that there are a lot of smart people who are dedicating themselves to making this technology easier for you to use. There is less need for confirmation, problem-solving, and configuration every day. If a decentralized system is simply too technical for you right now, check it out again soon. It's getting simpler every day, from a user's perspective.

It also bears mentioning that you can be one of those smart people working on Ethereum. Perhaps the biggest pro-Ethereum argument out there is that your contributions matter.

If you use a smart contract or transact on Ethereum, you're doing something to support the entire network. If you give feedback to a developer, asking for new features or reporting issues, that's even better. You can even contribute directly by documenting, translating, coding, or starting your own project.

### Basic Ethereum safety {#safety-ethereum}

For now, if you learn about anything, learn about safety and security. It's imperative that you take some basic steps to keep your funds safe when you're starting out on Ethereum:

- [Learn about how wallets work](https://ethereum.org/en/wallets/)
- Confirm (before interacting with a smart contract) that your wallet or exchange account can interact with smart contracts
- Triple-check destination addresses, even if you're sending things to yourself or to exchanges
- Send small test transactions before sending big amounts
- Understand the difference between pseudonymous and private (most blockchains are public, pseudonymous records)
- Above all else, **back up and do not share** private keys or mnemonic phrases (long strings of random words) with others.

The final part is the most important. To reiterate, your mnemonic is usually a 12-to-24-word phrase. These random word phrases represent the master keys to your funds and are **for your eyes only**. These should **only** ever be typed **directly into your wallet**, nowhere else.

If you lose your phrase, you lose access. Conversely, anyone who has it has access. It's as simple as that.

Don't, **don't** share your secret passphrases. Not with customer service, not with friends, not with financial advisors, not with airport security, not with business partners, not with anyone.

There are secure ways to accomplish shared access or delegated management, such as using a multi-signature wallet or a smart contract. Just don't share your mnemonic passphrase.

## Decentralized systems can be more efficient {#efficiency-in-decentralization}

Decentralized systems eliminate the need to trust third-party intermediaries. They return some control over your decisions. As a direct result of these two things, they can lower overhead.

### Less to pay for {#operational-efficiency}

Decentralization cuts out the intermediary. When you pay a centralized credit card company a percentage of every purchase, you are paying for:

- The trusted position of the processor as a third party
- The point-of-sale infrastructure
- Growth of the processor's corporation
- Fat executive compensation packages
- The cost of executing the transaction

In Ethereum, you pay:

- The cost of running and securing the network (which network operators do at a profit)

### Less to shuffle around {#organizational-efficiency}

On Ethereum specifically, you pay what's called [gas](/glossary#gas). Gas is a pretty complex subject, but it boils down to being a network fee — at least from your perspective as a user. You pay more when your transactions use more network resources.

Payment processing fees from traditional services like Visa or Paypal derive from a labyrinthine mess of promotional rates, business partnerships, bulk discounts, regional interests, exchange rates, and arbitrary decisions by corporations. Ethereum gas fees derive from a transparent, community-defined set of rules that balances the interests of network operators and users. Once the rules are in place, they automatically execute the same way for every transaction.

## Ethereum is the perfect decentralized system! Right? {#challenges-to-ethereum}

So, Ethereum is a perfect, utopian decentralized computing system, right? Not so fast.

The network works, but it's still a work in progress. Also, like most decentralized systems, Ethereum prioritizes some forms of decentralization over others.

Becoming even more awesome is always on the agenda, though. Here are some things the community is working towards:

- **Increased [client diversity](/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients#advantages-of-different-implementations)**: Diverse software means less chance for a single bug or attack to cause a major problem.
- **Better geographical distribution of network operators (active participants in many different countries)**: Having nodes in many different places reduces the risk of government interference, outages from regional disasters, etc.
- **Distribution of ETH balances (already one of the most even distributions in crypto)**: Currency value is at risk for manipulation when the supply is largely controlled by a single entity or group of associated entities. In other words, a centralized group can decide how much is available. Increased distribution reduces this risk.
- **Increased cooperation between the Ethereum community and other decentralized projects**: Ethereum is at the infrastructure level for the decentralized web. Linking other projects and building more applications increases competition, but it also increases utility.
- **Better communication between network operators, users, and software developers**: Communication helps identify potential uses and resolve issues. Sometimes one group will have a perspective that the others did not consider.

## Not all crypto and blockchain projects are decentralized {#centralized-vs-decentralized}

"Blockchain/crypto" does not equal "decentralized". The fact is that most systems have aspects of centralization and decentralization. These design concepts can and do coexist.

So the question becomes what types of decentralization are practical? What types of centralization do we absolutely need? As mentioned above, Ethereum needs to have a central set of computing rules, or else the machine wouldn't know what to do.

Let's look at a couple of examples.

### Example 1: United States Dollar coins {#usd-on-ethereum}

We'll start with stablecoins. Stablecoins are digital assets designed to match the value of a (low-volatility) national currency.

For example, USDC is a United-States-Dollar-value cryptocurrency. At the time of writing, the USDC website states it to be "backed by fully reserved assets." It is controlled in a relatively centralized way: via a permissioned consortium founded by two big corporations.

DAI is another US-dollar-value coin. You create it by first depositing crypto assets with an automated program (a smart contract). After the deposit goes through, you can borrow DAI against your collateral.

DAI was/is developed by a group called [MakerDAO](https://makerdao.com/en/). For governance, people who hold the MKR asset get to vote on how the program behaves, fees for borrowing against various deposited assets, and so on. Overall, it's far more decentralized than USDC.

If you're interested in a deeper dive into stablecoin decentralization, check out the [interesting relationship between USDC and DAI](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/onboarding-usdc-as-collateral-to-mitigate-liquidity-risk/1570). Yet another example of how centralization is a spectrum — not an absolute.

To sum up:

- USDC has ties to centralized institutions. It has perks and risks associated with doing business with or trusting those institutions.
- DAI comes from a decentralized project. DAI currency is backed with crypto assets rather than fiat, and comes with its own risks and benefits.

### Example 2: Currency exchanges {#exchanges}

There are centralized and decentralized crypto exchanges. Here's a table of how Uniswap, a decentralized exchange, compares to Coinbase, a centralized one.

| Uniswap                                                                                                               | Coinbase                                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| You send an asset to a contract. The contract executes your trade and returns another asset.                          | You deposit your assets with the exchange. You can then trade and withdraw once your deposit clears.                                                                          |
| You must trust the smart contract to execute correctly.                                                               | You must trust the exchange to hold your assets, execute your trades, secure your personal information, maintain adequate depth for withdrawals, and operate disinterestedly. |
| Users publicly provide paired liquidity.                                                                              | Market makers enter into private deals with the exchange. Traders deposit on the exchange.                                                                                    |
| Trading fees go to a development fund and liquidity provider payments.                                                | Trading fees go to the company.                                                                                                                                               |
| Transaction fees depend on Ethereum network conditions.                                                               | Trading transactions happen internally, not on the blockchain.                                                                                                                |
| Participants can help [make decisions](https://gov.uniswap.org) about the exchange.                                   | Corporate executives and shareholders make decisions.                                                                                                                         |

## The history the decentralized web {#history-of-decentralization}

In the early days of computer networking, things were relatively centralized. Computers were too expensive for most people. Institutions (and departments within institutions) ran their own services. The services were often proprietary and incapable of smooth intercommunication.

Then came a collaboration between a Department of Defense lab and an Ivy League university. This resulted in the transmission control and internet protocols (TCP/IP), which were followed by several other core internet standards. These standards led to massive decentralization in communications.

Federated councils of institutions eventually progressed to nebulous networks of individual programmers and service providers. We now have a system where an astounding number of people have the hardware resources to develop, operate, and access services using basic, universal protocols.

But web activity is conglomerating under the control of a handful of states, advertisers, and infrastructure providers. Many are duplicating services, making it difficult for people to interoperate, and even forming cabalistic partnerships or engaging in aggressive corporate acquisition strategies.

### The future of decentralization {#future-of-decentralization}

Decentralization was a huge part of the internet's success. It's still around right now, baked right in — but it's under pressure from centralizing forces that are building a less free, less interoperable system.

Ethereum and many other blockchain projects are built on similar principles. Like the end-to-end principle increased reliability in communications, Ethereum aims to increase it in financial transactions. In the broadest sense, it's about open, reliable communication — without any third-party intermediaries censoring, controlling, owning, impeding, or otherwise diminishing our experience.

## Supporting and exploring the decentralized web {#exploration}

Decentralized systems typically depend on individuals who run nodes. Are you an individual, by chance? If you have the basic hardware, you can run an Ethereum node at home. One of the best things you can do to support the ecosystem is [running one of the minority clients](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/03/23/supporting-ethereums-client-ecosystem/).

What's in it for you? You will have a cool computer networking project and you'll be contributing to the speed and defense of the [Ethereum Virtual Machine](/glossary#evm). Once your node is secure, you can also use it as an Ethereum wallet (or for a number of other advanced applications). There are even several public testnets if you don't want to start out risking real money.

### Decentralized apps (dapps) {#dapps}

Decentralized apps are — wait for it — apps that follow decentralized design principles. There are a ton of these on Ethereum because the network allows for complex computing tasks, beyond sending coins from one address to another.

### Decentralized finance (defi) {#defi}

If you're sensing a pattern here, you're right: Defi is finance that follows decentralized design principles. Loans, securities, market indices, derivatives, even tokenized tokens — there's a lot out there.
