DAOs are an effective and safe way to work with like-minded folks around the globe.

Think of them like an internet-native business thats collectively owned and managed by its members. They have built-in treasuries that no one has the authority to access without the approval of the group. Decisions are governed by proposals and voting to ensure everyone in the organisation has a voice.

There's no CEO who can authorise spending based on their own whims and no chance of a dodgy CFO manipulating the books. Everything is out in the open and the rules around spending are baked into the DAO via its code.

### Examples

To help this make more sense, here's a few examples of how you could use a DAO:

- A charity â€“ you can accept membership and donations from anyone and the group can decide how they want their donations are spent.
- Fund social activities
- Grants, investments and ventures

?DO WE NEED TO GO INTO THIS LEVEL OF DETAIL?
governance-token based DAOs

- I have tokens that give me voting power and I can trade these on the open market
  shares-based DAOs
- I have a token that represents my share in the group funds. I can redeem my funds using the token.

## How do DAOs work?

DAOs are smart contract-based. The business rules are written into the code and deployed to the Ethereum mainnet. Once there and live, the rules can't be broken by anyone. If anyone tries to do something that's not covered by the rules and logic in the code, it wil fail.

[Add example business logic here]

As a type of Ethereum account, smart contracts can hold funds and distribute them based on certain conditions. This forms your organisation's treasury. A DAO smart contract has functions in the code that prevent any funds leaving the account without the consensus of the oranisation's membership.
