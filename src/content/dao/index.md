DAOs are an effective and safe way to work with like-minded folks around the globe.

Think of them like an internet-native business that's collectively owned and managed by its members. They have built-in treasuries that no one has the authority to access without the approval of the group. Decisions are governed by proposals and voting to ensure everyone in the organisation has a voice.

There's no CEO who can authorise spending based on their own whims and no chance of a dodgy CFO manipulating the books. Everything is out in the open and the rules around spending are baked into the DAO via its code.

### Examples

To help this make more sense, here's a few examples of how you could use a DAO:

- A charity – you can accept membership and donations from anyone and the group can decide how they to spend donations.
- A freelancer network – you could create a network of contractors who pool their funds for office spaces and software subscriptions.
- Ventures and grants – you could create a venture fund that pools investment capital and votes on ventures to back. Repaid money could later be redistributed amongst DAO-members.

### Why do we need DAOs?

- Starting an organisation with someone that involves funding requires a lot of trust. It's hard to trust someone you've only ever interacted with on the internet. With DAOs you don't need to trust the other individuals in the group, just the DAO's rules.

?DO WE NEED TO GO INTO THIS LEVEL OF DETAIL?
governance-token based DAOs

- I have tokens that give me voting power and I can trade these on the open market
  shares-based DAOs
- I have a token that represents my share in the group funds. I can redeem my funds using the token.

## How do DAOs work?

The backbone of a DAO is its smart contract. The contract defines the rules of the organisation and holds the group's treasury. Once the contract is live on Ethereum, no one can change the rules except by a vote. If anyone tries to do something that's not covered by the rules and logic in the code, it will fail. And because the treasury is defined by the smart contract too that means no one can spend the money without the group's approval either. This means that DAOs don't need a central authority. Instead the group makes decisions collectively and payments are authorised automatically when votes pass.

This is possible because smart contracts are basically untamperable when live on Ethereum. Code can't be tweaked without people noticing because everything is public.

## Ethereum and DAOs

Ethereum is the perfect foundation for DAOs for a number of reasons:

- Smart contract code can't be modified once live, even by its owners. This allows the DAO to run by the rules it was programmed with.
- Smart contracts can send/receive funds. Without this you'd need a trusted intermediary to manage group funds.
