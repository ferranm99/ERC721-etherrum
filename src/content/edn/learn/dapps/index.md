# Introduction to dapps

A dapp is an application built on a decentralized network that combines a [smart contract](/en/edn/learn/smart-contracts/) and a frontend. Note, in Ethereum smart-contracts are accessible and transparent – like open APIs – so your dapp can even include a smart contract that someone else has written.

## Prerequisites

Before learning about dapps, you should cover the blockchain basics and read about the Ethereum network and how it's decentralized.

## Definition of a dapp

A dapp has its backend code running on a decentralized peer-to-peer network. Contrast this with an app where the backend code is running on centralized servers.

A dapp can have frontend code and user interfaces written in any language (just like an app) that can make calls to its backend. Furthermore, its frontend can be hosted on decentralized storage such as [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/).

- **Decentralized** that makes them independent, and no one controls them.
- **Deterministic** i.e., they perform the same function irrespective of the environment they are executed.
- **Turing compatible**, which means given the required resources, the dapp can perform any action.
- **Isolated**, which means they are executed in a virtual environment known as Ethereum Virtual Machine so that if the smart contract happens to have a bug, it won’t hamper the normal functioning of the blockchain network.

### On smart contracts

To introduce dapps, we need to introduce smart contracts – a dapp's backend for lack of a better term. For a detailed overview head to our section on [smart contracts](/en/edn/learn/smart-contracts/).

A smart contract is code that lives on the Ethereum blockchain and runs exactly as programmed. Once they are deployed on the network you can't change them. Dapps can be decentralized because they are controlled by the logic written into the contract, not an individual or company. This also means you need to design your contracts very carefully and test them thoroughly.

## Benefits of dapp development

- No down-time
- No single point of failure
- Permissionless
- Censorship resistant
- Open source

## Implications of dapp development

- Transparency – transactions that trigger dapp functionality are public
- Open source
- Cost of storage – contracts are often only small percentages of the dapp. They are stored on-chain and this storage needs to be paid for, so it can be expensive.

## What are dapps good for?

- Removing need for intermediaries
-

## Types of dapp

- Involving money
- Involving money and something else
- Other, including decentralized autonomous organizations

The application has to be open-source, operate autonomously, and can not be controlled by any one entity.
All data and record must be cryptographically stored in a public, decentralized blockchain.
The app must use a cryptographic token, also referred to as an App Coin, to access the application.
Tokens must be generated in order to prove the value nodes that contribute to the application.
