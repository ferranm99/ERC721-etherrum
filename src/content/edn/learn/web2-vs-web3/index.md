# Web2 vs Web3

What does web3 refer to?

| Web2                                    | Web3                                          |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Twitter can censor any account or tweet | Uncensorable because control is decentralized |
|                                         |                                               |

This doesn't mean that all services need to be turned into a dapp. These examples are illustrative to show the main differences between web2 and web3 services.

## Centralization vs decentralization

<!--Content below provided by Brian Gu-->

In the table below, we list some of the broad-strokes advantages and disadvantages of centralized and decentralized digital networks.

| Centralized Systems                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Decentralized Systems                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Low network diameter (all participants are connected to a central authority); information propagates quickly, as propagation is handled by a central authority with lots of computational resources.                   | The furthest participants on the network may potentially be many edges away from each other. Information broadcast from one side of the network may take a long time to reach the other side.                                    |
| Usually higher performance (higher throughput, fewer total computational resources expended) and easier to implement.                                                                                                  | Usually lower performance (lower throughput, more total computational resources expended) and more complex to implement.                                                                                                         |
| In the event of conflicting data, resolution is clear and easy: the ultimate source of truth is the central authority.                                                                                                 | A protocol (often complex) is needed for dispute resolution, if peers make conflicting claims about the state of data which participants are meant to be synchronized on.                                                        |
| Single point of failure: malicious actors may be able to take down the network by targeting the central authority.                                                                                                     | No single point of failure: network can still function even if a large proportion of participants are attacked/taken out.                                                                                                        |
| Coordination among network participants is much easier, and is handled by a central authority. Central authority can compel network participants to adopt upgrades, protocol updates, etc., with very little friction. | Coordination is often difficult, as no single agent has the final say in network-level decisions, protocol upgrades, etc. In the worst case, network is prone to fracturing when there are disagreements about protocol changes. |
| Central authority can censor data, potentially cutting off parts of the network from interacting with the rest of the network.                                                                                         | Censorship is much harder, as information has many ways to propagate across the network.                                                                                                                                         |
| Participation in the network is controlled by the central authority.                                                                                                                                                   | Anyone can participate in the network; there are no “gatekeepers.” Ideally, the cost of participation is very low.                                                                                                               |

Note that these are general patterns that may not hold true in every network. Furthermore, in reality the degree to which a network is centralized/decentralized lies on a spectrum; no network is entirely centralized or entirely decentralized.
