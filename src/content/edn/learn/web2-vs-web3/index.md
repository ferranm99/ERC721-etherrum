What does web3 refer to?

| Web2                                    | Web3                                          |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Twitter can censor any account or tweet | Uncensorable because control is decentralized |
|                                         |                                               |

This doesn't mean that all services need to be turned into a dapp. These examples are illustrative to show the main differences between web2 and web3 services.
