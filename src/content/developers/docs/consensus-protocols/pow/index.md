Ethereum, like Bitcoin, currently uses a consensus protocol called [Proof of Work (PoW)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work) consensus protocol. This allows the nodes of the Ethereum network to agree on the state of all information recorded on the Ethereum blockchain, and prevents certain kinds of economic attacks.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

To better understand this page, we recommend you first read up on [transactions](/en/developers/docs/transactions/) and [blocks](/en/developers/docs/blocks/).

## What is Proof of Work (PoW)?

In decentralized systems like Ethereum, we need to ensure that everyone agrees on the order of transactions. The Proof of Work consensus mechanism allows Ethereum to achieve this.

The Proof of Work consensus mechanism is currently the most widely-used consensus mechanism. It was pioneered by Satoshi Nakamoto with the release of Bitcoin in 2008 and it has powered the majority of high-profile blockchains, including Ethereum.

## What is mining?

Mining is the lifeblood of Proof of Work. It is the process of creating a block transactions to be added to the Ethereum blockchain.

Miners operate by solving computationally difficult puzzles in order to produce blocks, which serves as a way to secure the network from attacks. In return, they receive a reward in the form of newly minted ETH.
