## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

To better understand this page, we recommend you first read up on [consensus mechanisms](/developers/docs/consensus-protocols/).

## What is Proof of Stake (PoS)?

Proof of stake is a type of [consensus mechanism](/developers/docs/consensus-protocols/) used by blockchain networks to achieve distributed consensus. For Ethereum, the purpose of Proof of Stake is the same as [Proof of Work](/developers/docs/consensus-protocols/pow/) - to ensure that all nodes agree the state of the network and on the order of transactions.

Proof of Stake comes with a number of improvements compared to [Proof of Work](/developers/docs/consensus-protocols/pow/), including: energy efficiency, lower barriers to entry, stronger crypto-economic incentives.
