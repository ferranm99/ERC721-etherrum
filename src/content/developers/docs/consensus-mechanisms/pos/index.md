Ethereum is moving to a consensus mechanism called proof-of-stake (PoS) from [proof-of-work (PoW)](/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow/). This was always the plan as it's a key part in the community's strategy to scale Ethereum via [the Eth2 upgrades](/eth2/). However getting PoS right is a big technical challenge and not as straightforward as using PoW to reach consensus across the network.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

To better understand this page, we recommend you first read up on [consensus mechanisms](/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/).

## What is proof-of-stake (PoS)? {#what-is-pos}

Proof of stake is a type of [consensus mechanism](/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/) used by blockchain networks to achieve distributed consensus.

It requires users to stake their ETH to become a validator in the network. Validators are responsible for the same thing as miners in [proof-of-work](/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow/): ordering transactions and creating new blocks so that all nodes can agree on the state of the network.

Proof-of-stake comes with a number of improvements to the proof-of-work system, including:

- better energy efficiency
- lower barriers to entry
- stronger crypto-economic incentives
- stronger support for shard chains, a key upgrade in scaling the Ethereum network

## Finality {#finality}

As Vlad Zamfir put it, imagine a version of proof of work where if you participate in a 51% attack your mining hardware burns down.
