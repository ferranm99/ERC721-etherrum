You can use Ethereum to create decentralized applications (or "dapps") that utilize the benefits of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.
There are at least two currently maintained libraries for Dart to use the JSON RPC API for Ethereum.

1. [Web3dart from simonbutler.eu](https://pub.dev/packages/web3dart)
1. [Ethereum 5.0.0 from darticulate.com](https://pub.dev/packages/ethereum)

As well as additional libraries that allow you manipulate specifically Ethereum addresses, or that let you retrieve prices of various crypto
currencies. [You can see the full list here](https://pub.dev/dart/packages?q=ethereum).
