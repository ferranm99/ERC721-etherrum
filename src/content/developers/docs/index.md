Our developer platform will get help get you up to speed on Ethereum and help you choose your first Ethereum stack. Once you’re skilled up and have everything you need, you can move onto more advanced topics specific to what you’re building.

## How to use this platform

## Training modules

If this is your first attempt at Ethereum development, we recommend starting at the beginning and working you way through like a book.

### Fundamental topics

- [Blockchain basics](/en/developers/docs/blockchain-basics/) _– A quick overview of blockchains_
- [Web2 vs Web3](/en/developers/docs/web2-vs-web3/) _– The fundamental differences that blockchain-based applications provide_
- [Intro to dapps](/en/developers/docs/dapps/) _– An introduction to decentralized applications_
- [Programming languages](/en/developers/docs/programming-languages/) _– How to get started with Ethereum using languages you may already know_
- [The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)](/en/developers/docs/evm/) _– The EVM handles all the computation on the Ethereum network_
- [Blocks](/en/developers/docs/blocks/) _– The way transactions are batched to ensure state is synchronised across all actors_
- [Accounts](/en/developers/docs/accounts/) _– Entities in the network that can hold a balance and send transactions_
- [Transactions](/en/developers/docs/transactions/) _– Transfers and other actions that cause Ethereum's state to change_
- [Block explorers](/en/developers/docs/block-explorers/) _– A way to read data about transactions, accounts, blocks and the network_
- [Gas](/en/developers/docs/gas/) _– Computational power required to process transactions, paid for in ETH by transaction senders_
- [Mining](/en/developers/docs/mining/) _– The way transactions are processed and blocks are created_
- [Networks](/en/developers/docs/networks/) _– Implementations of Ethereum including test networks_
- [Nodes and clients](/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/) _– The individuals participating in the network and the software they run to verify transactions_

### The Ethereum stack

- [Intro to the stack](/en/developers/docs/intro-to-stack/) _– An overview of the Ethereum/web3 stack_
- [Smart contracts](/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/) _– Programs that reside at an Ethereum address and run functions when triggered by transactions_
- [Javascript client libraries](/en/developers/docs/javascript-client-libraries/) _– Convenience libraries that allow your web app to interact with Ethereum and smart contracts_
- [Security](/en/developers/docs/security/)
- [Storage](/en/developers/docs/storage/)
- [Development frameworks](/en/developers/docs/development-frameworks/) _– Tools that makes developing with Ethereum easier_
- [Development environments](/en/developers/docs/IDEs/) _– The best environments to write dapp code_

### Advanced
