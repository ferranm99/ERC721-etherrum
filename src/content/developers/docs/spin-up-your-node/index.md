Running own instance of full Ethereum client implementation provides various benefits to the user, opens new possibilities and helps to support the ecosystem. This page will guide through process of spinning up own node and participating in validating transactions on Ethereum blockchain. 

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

Reader should understand what is Ethereum node and motivation for running the client. This introduction is covered in [Nodes and clients](/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/) page. 

## Choosing an approach {#choosing-approach}

First step in creating an Ethereum node is to choose the approach. User has to choose which implementation he wants to run, what kind of environment will be the instance deployed on and parameters to start the client with. 

### Client implementations {#client-implementations}

Stable mainnet clients currently include Geth, OpenEthereum, Nethermind and Besu. Each has different advantages and requirements. [Section about different client implementations in Nodes and clients page](/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/#advantages-of-different-implementations) should help you to pick software which suits your needs.


#### Client settings {#client-settings}

Client implementations enable different sync modes and various other options. All features and options can be found in documentation of each client.
Before starting the node, user should decide what network and sync mode to use. 

Different sync modes are shortly explained in [Nodes and clients page](/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/#sync-modes). Overview of flags to start clients with can be found in [ethub docs](https://docs.ethhub.io/using-ethereum/running-an-ethereum-node/#client-settings), for further details on flag options, please look into documentation for each client.
For testing purposes, user might prefer running client on one of testnet networks. Overview of supported networks and sync modes can be found in [Clients section](/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/#clients). 
Most important factor which depends on these settings is how much disk space will be required for database, therefore what drive will be needed.

### Environment and hardware {#environment-and-hardware}

#### Local or cloud {#local-vs-cloud}
Ethereum clients are able to run on consumer grade computers and don't require special hardware like mining for example. Therefore user has various options where to deploy the instance depending on individual needs. 
To simplify the case, let's divide our possibilities to running node on local physical machine and renting server in the cloud: 
- Cloud
    - Providers offer high server uptime, static public IP addresses
    - Getting dedicated or virtual server can be more comfortable then building own
    - Trade off is trusting a third party - server provider
    - Because of required storage size for full node, price of a rented server might get high
- Own hardware
    - More trustless and sovereign approach
    - One time investment 
    - An option to buy preconfigured machines 
    - Requires to physically prepare the machine, maintain it and solve possible issues with networking

Both options have different advantages summed up above. If you are looking for a cloud solution, in addition to many traditional cloud computing providers, there are also services focused on deploying nodes, for example [QuikNode](https://www.quiknode.io/), [Blockdaemon](https://blockdaemon.com), [LunaNode](https://www.lunanode.com/). 
Censorship resistant and decentralized network should not rely on cloud providers infrastructure. For running Ethereum node locally, check Hardware section below. Easiest options are preconfigured machines like [DappNode](https://dappnode.io/) or [Avado](https://ava.do/). 

#### Hardware {#hardware}

Minimum and recommended requirements are summed up in [Nodes and clients page section](/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/#requirements). 
Generally, modest computing power should be enough, bottleneck is usually speed of a drive. During initial sync, Ethereum client performs a lot of read/write operations, therefore SSD is strongly recommended. Client might even [not be able to sync current state on HDD](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/16796#issuecomment-391649278) and get stuck few blocks behind mainnet. 
Some clients offer builds for different architectures which makes possible to run it on [SCBs with ARM](/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/#ethereum-on-a-single-board-computer/). Another easy way is using [Ethbian](https://ethbian.org/index.html) operating system for Raspberry Pi 4 which enables [run Ethereum client by simply flashing SD card](/en/developers/tutorials/run-node-raspberry-pi/).
Depending on the chosen software and the hardware, the initial synchronization time and storage requirements may vary. Check [orientational table](/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/#recommended-specifications) in Nodes and clients page. 
Also make sure your internet connection is not limited by [bandwidth cap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_cap). It is recommended to use unmetered connection since initial sync and network gossip could exceed limits of your ISP. 

#### Operating system {#operating-system}

All clients support major operating systems - Linux, MacOS, Windows. This enables to run client on regular desktop or server machine with OS that suits user the best. Make sure OS is up to date to avoid potential issues and security vulnerabilities. 


## Spinning up the node {#spinning-up-node}

### Getting the client software {#getting-the-client}

First, let's download chosen client software itself. 

Users can simply download executable application or installation package which suits their operating system and architecture. It is always recommended to verify signatures and checksums of downloaded packages. Some clients also offer repositories for easier installation and updates. 
Developers might prefer building from source. All of the clients are open source and it is easy to build them from source code with proper compiler. 

Stable mainnet client implementations, summarized on page above, can be downloaded from their release pages - [Geth](https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/), [OpenEthereum,](https://github.com/openethereum/openethereum/releases) [Nethermind](https://downloads.nethermind.io/), [Besu](https://pegasys.tech/solutions/hyperledger-besu/). 

### Starting the client {#starting-the-client}

Before starting Ethereum client software, perform last check that the environment is ready for deploying it. For example, make sure:
- There is enough disk space considering chosen network and sync mode.
- Memory and CPU is not halt by other programs.
- Operating system is updated to latest version.
- System has correct time and date.
- Make sure your router and firewall accepts connection on listening ports. By default Ethereum clients use a listener (TCP) port and a discovery (UDP) port, both on 30303 by default.

Running client on testnet first might help to make sure everything is working as expected. For example refer to [tutorial on running Geth light node](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/tutorials/run-light-node-geth/
). 
Any client settings deviating from default have to be declared on the start. Configuration to execute client with can be declared as flags in the command or with config file to preserve same options without need to specify flags. These startup options may vary by client, please refer to documentation of chosen software. 
Client execution will initiate its core functions, chosen endpoints and start looking for peers. After successfully discovering peers, client starts synchronization. Current blockchain data will be available once client is successfully synced to the current state. 

### Using the client {#using-the-client}

Client software is running in the background. For interacting with it, implementations offer RPC API endpoints. Controlling the client and interacting with Ethereum network can be done in various ways using these RPC endpoints:
- Manualy by calling them with suitable protocol
- Attaching provided console 
- By applications implementing them

Implementations of RPCs endpoints and methods can slightly differ between clients. Generally spread is JSON-RPC which can be used with all client implementations. For general overview, refer to [this eth.wiki article. ](https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API). 
This RPC can be used by applications requiring info from Ethereum network, for example wallets. For instance, popular wallet Metamask [allows easily add RPC URL to use local instance](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015290012-Using-a-Local-Node). 

#### Reaching RPC {#reaching-rpc}
Ports of all local endpoints can be modified in config, default port of JSON-RPC is `8545`. This RPC interface is by default reachable only on localhost of the computer. If you want to directly expose it to public,its address can be changed to `"0.0.0.0"`. This way, it will be reachable over local and public IP address. In most cases, to reach endpoint publicly you will also need to setup port forwarding on the router. 

But beware, because this way anybody on the internet can control your node. Malicious actors could misuse it to e.g. halt your system or steal funds if client is used as wallet. Which RPC methods are allowed can be modified in configuration, those potentially harmful can be excluded. For example while starting `geth`, you can determine allowed method sets with a flag `--http.api web3,eth,txpool`. 

Other ways how to expose RPC can be indirectly using web server like Nginx. You can easily host access to the RPC by pointing web service to client's local address and port. 

For privacy preserving and easy to setup publicly reachable endpoint, hosting it on own [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) onion service might be a good option. This enables you to reach RPC outside your local network even without static public IP address and opened ports. 
After installing `tor`, edit `torrc` config and configure hidden service pointing to client's RPC address and port. After restarting tor, it will generate hidden service keys and hostname in desired directory. Your RPC will be reachable on this `.onion` hostname.

### Operating the node {#operating-the-node}

Ethereum node should be also regularly maintained and monitored. 

#### Keeping node online {#keeping-node-online}
Ethereum client doesn't have to be online *nonstop* but should be kept online most of the time to stay in sync. It can be shutdown and restarted, just keep in mind:
- Shutting down a client can take a while, even few minutes if recent state is being written on disk. Avoid forced shutdowns which could damage the database.
- Client will loose synchronization to current state of the network and after starting it again, it will need some time to resync. 

#### Creating client service {#creating-client-service}
Consider running client automatically on startup. For example on Linux servers, good practice would be creating a service that executes the client with proper config, user and automatically restarts.
 
#### Updating client {#updating-client}

Regular updates of client are necessary for keeping up with latest security patches, EIPs and features. Especially before hard forks, make sure you are running latest desired version of the client. 

#### Running additional services {#running-additional-services}
Running own node enables to use services which are built on top of Ethereum and require direct access to Ethereum client RPC. For example second layer solutions, [Eth 2.0 clients](https://launchpad.ethereum.org/) or other software from Ethereum infrastructure. 

#### Monitoring the node {#monitoring-the-node}
For proper monitoring your node, consider collecting metrics. Clients provide metrics endpoint to export comprehensive data about the node. This can be used by tools like InfluxDB or Prometheus to create chronological database. Database like this can be visualized in charts using data visualization software Grafana. You can find many setups for using this software and also different Grafana dashboards for visualizing data about your node and Ethereum network. 
This monitoring can include the machine performance which should be also kept eye on. Especially during initial sync, client might be heavy on CPU and RAM. Without Grafana, simply check server performance with tools your OS offers like `htop` or `uptime`.
