The Ethereum platform creates, stores and transfers large volumes of data. It is critical that this data is formatted in ways that are standardized and memory efficient so that nodes can be run on relatively modest consumer-grade hardware. To achieve this, there are several specific data structures that are used on the Ethereum stack.

## Prerequisites

It is useful to have a good understanding of the ethereum blockchain and client software. Familiarity with the networking layer would also be useful. This is quite low level information about how the Ethereum protocol is designed. A reasonable understanding of the Ethereum whitepaper is recommended.

## Data Structures

### Patricia merkle trees

coming soon

### Recursive Length Prefix

Recursive-length prefix is a serialization method used extensively across Ethereum's execution layer. Detailed information about RLP can be found [here](developers/docs/data-structures/rlp).

### Simple Serialize
