## Scaling Overview {#scaling-overview}

The scalability of a blockchain is measured in transactions per second. On the Ethereum blockchain network congestion leads to slower transactions and nonviable gas prices. Increasing the network capacity (transactions per second) is fundamental to the meaningful and mass adoption of Ethereum. Conceptually scaling can be categorised as either on-chain scaling or off-chain scaling.

## On-Chain Scaling {#on-chain-scaling}

### Sharding

Sharding is the process of splitting a database horizontally to spread the load. In an Ethereum context, sharding will reduce network congestion and increase transactions per second by creating new chains, known as “shards”.
