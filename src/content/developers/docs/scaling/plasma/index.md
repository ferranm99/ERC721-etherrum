A plasma chain is a separate blockchain that is anchored to the main Ethereum chain, and uses fraud proofs (like [optimistic rollups](/developers/docs/scaling/optimistic-rollups/)) to arbitrate disputes. These chains are sometimes referred to as "child" chains as they are essentially smaller copies of the Ethereum Mainnet. Merkle trees enable creation of a limitless stack of these chains that can work to offload bandwidth from the parent chains (including Mainnet). These derive their security through [fraud proofs](/glossary/#fraud-proof), and each child chain has its own mechanism for block validation.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

You should have a good understanding of all the foundational topics and a high-level understanding of [Ethereum scaling](/developers/docs/scaling/). Implementing scaling solutions such as Plasma is an advanced topic as the technology is less battle-tested, and continues to be researched and developed.

## Pros and cons {#pros-and-cons}

| High throughput, low cost per transaction.                                                                            | Does not support general computation. Only basic token transfers, swaps, and a few other transaction types are supported via predicate logic.                               |
| Good for transactions between arbitrary users (no overhead per user pair if both are established on the plasma chain) | Need to periodically watch the network (liveness requirement) or delegate this responsibility to someone else to ensure the security of your funds.                         |
|  Plasma chains can be adapted to specific use-cases that are unrelated to the main chain. Anyone, including businesses, can customize Plasma smart contracts to provide scalable infrastructure that works in different contexts.                                                       | Relies on one or more operators to store data and serve it upon request.                                                                                              |

## How does Plasma differ from sidechains and sharding? 

Plasma, sidechains, and sharding all follow a similar pattern where a collection of "child chains" rely on a "main chain" for consensus. At intervals, cryptographic proofs of transaction validity (hashes) are submitted to the main chain to prevent fraudulent activity on child chains. 

However, the three scaling solutions have slight differences. Here is a quick comparison of Plasma chains, sidechains, and shard chains:

### Plasma vs sidechains  

A [sidechain](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/sidechains/) is a blockchain operating independently but connects to the main blockchain (Ethereum Mainnet) via a two-way bridge. [Bridges](https://ethereum.org/en/bridges/) allow users to exchange tokens between both blockchains, so they can transact on the sidechainâ€”reducing congestion on the base layer and improving scalability. 
With sidechains, there's the risk of losing your funds. Sidechains use a separate consensus mechanism and, ergo, cannot rely on the security of Ethereum Mainnet (Layer 1).

Conversely, Plasma chains are somewhat safer than sidechains because they derive their security from Ethereum's base layer. Like sidechains, Plasma chains can have a  different consensus protocol. 

The difference is that Plasma publishes Merkle roots for each block on the Ethereum main chain. Block roots are small pieces of information we can use to verify information about transactions that happen on a Plasma chain. If an attack happens on a Plasma chain, users can safely exit to the main chain and withdraw their funds using the appropriate proofs. 

A simple way to differentiate between Plasma and sidechains is that Plasma chains are non-custodial, while sidechains are custodial. 

### Plasma vs sharding

Both Plasma chains and [shard chains](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/shard-chains/) periodically publish cryptographic proofs on the main chain. However, both have different security properties. 
Shard chains are tightly coupled to the main chain, but plasma chains are not. Even if one shard block is invalid, the entire chain will reorganize and discard the invalid block. Thus, shard chains can be as safe as the main chain. 

While Plasma chains can benefit from Layer 1 security, they are not as tightly linked to the main chain as shard chains. It's possible to commit an invalid Plasma block header to the main chain since the larger network has little information about the state of the Plasma chain. 

With sharding, the main chain knows how sharded sub-chains should operate and can reject an invalid shard transition. The upside to Plasma is the effects of a malicious activity can be restricted to the child chain, while the effect on malicious activity on shard chains would affect the entire network. 

### Use Plasma {#use-plasma}

Multiple projects provide implementations of Plasma that you can integrate into your dapps:

- [OMG Network](https://omg.network/)
- [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) (previously Matic Network)
- [Gluon](https://gluon.network/)
- [LeapDAO](https://ipfs.leapdao.org/)
