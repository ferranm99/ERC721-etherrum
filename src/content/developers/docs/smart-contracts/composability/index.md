## A brief introduction

Smart contracts are public on Ethereum and can be thought of as open APIs. You don't need to write your own smart contract to become a dapp developer, you just need to know how to interact with them. For example, you can use a [Uniswap](https://uniswap.exchange/swap) app smart contract to do all the token transfers in your app – you don't need to start from scratch. [Check out some of their contracts](https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v2-core/tree/master/contracts).
