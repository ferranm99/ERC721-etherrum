Congrats! You’ve made it to the shortest and simplest part of our NFT tutorial series — how to view your freshly minted NFT on a virtual wallet. We’ll be using Metamask for this example since it is what we used in the previous two parts.

As a prerequisite, you should already have Metamask on mobile installed, and it should include the account to which you minted your NFT — you can get the app for free on [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/metamask-blockchain-wallet/id1438144202) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.metamask&hl=en_US&gl=US) .

## Step 1: Set your network to Ropsten

At the top of the app, press the “Wallet” button, after which you’ll be prompted to select a network. As our NFT was minted on the Ropsten network, you’ll want to select Ropsten as your network.

## Step 2: Add your collectable to Metamask

Once you’re on the Ropsten network, select the “Collectibles” tab on the right and add the NFT smart contract address and the ERC-721 token ID of your NFT — which you should be able to find on Etherscan based on the transaction hash from your NFT deployed in Part II of our tutorial.

You may need to refresh a couple times to view your NFT — but it will be there! 😄
