# What you'll learn
- Testing a simple smart contract with Waffle library

## Assumptions
- You possess very basic knowledge of smart contracts and Solidity
- You got ts-node and typescript already included in your project
# Getting started with Waffle

Open the terminal inside of your project folder and run 
```
yarn add --dev ethereum-waffle
```
or alternatively if you use npm
```bash
npm install --save-dev ethereum-waffle
```
That will add the Waffle library to your project. You should now see ``node_modules`` directory along with ``package.json`` and ``yarn.lock`` files.

## Example smart contract

Below you can see a simple smart contract that we'll work on. Itâ€™s functionality comes down to splitting Wei equally and transfering them to two receivers. For each transfer, the contract emits a Transfer event.

Do you wonder why the even number of Wei is actually required? Well, if we split an uneven number of Wei, as shown below, one Wei would be lost forever! We won't let that happen and for the purpose of this tutorial, we'll revert transaction when someone tries to split an uneven number of Wei. While presenting Waffle matchers, we'll show how to test if the transaction was actually reverted.

Copy below code and place it in ``src/EtherSplitter.sol``.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.6.0;

contract EtherSplitter {
    address payable receiver1;
    address payable receiver2;

    event Transfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount);

    constructor(address payable _address1, address payable _address2) public {
        receiver1 = _address1;
        receiver2 = _address2;
    }
    
    function split() public payable {
        require(msg.value % 2 == 0, 'Uneven Wei amount not allowed');
        receiver1.transfer(msg.value / 2);
        emit Transfer(msg.sender, receiver1, msg.value / 2);
        receiver2.transfer(msg.value / 2);
        emit Transfer(msg.sender, receiver2, msg.value / 2);
    }
}
```

## Compile the contract
Before testing part starts, we want to compile our Ether splitter contract, so we must add the following entry to the package.json file:
```json
"scripts": {
    "build": "waffle"
  }
```
Next, in the project root directory, create ``waffle.json`` file (it's important to preserve the name!) and paste the following code there:
```json
  "compilerType": "solcjs",
  "compilerVersion": "0.6.2",
  "sourceDirectory": "./src",
  "outputDirectory": "./build"
}
```
Save everything and run ``` yarn build ```. As a result, the ``build`` directory should appear and our compiled contract should be inside it.

# Testing with Waffle
Now comes the best part! Let's do this! 

Tests in Waffle are written using Mocha and Chai. Therefore, run the following command to add mocha and chai to your project:
```bash
yarn add --dev mocha @types/mocha chai
```
or with npm:
```bash
npm install --save-dev mocha @types/mocha chai @types/chai
```

To enable running your tests, update your  package.json file and add the ``"test"`` entry in the scripts part:
```json
"scripts": {
    "build": "waffle",
    "test": "export NODE_ENV=test && mocha 'test/**/*.test.ts'"
  }
```
If you want to execute your tests, just run ```yarn test``` in your console.

Now create the ``test`` directory and put the new file ``EtherSplitter.test.ts`` there. This is where we'll be writing some tests for our contract. 
Copy the snippet below and save it to our test file. It's our base to which will gradually add some tests.
```ts
import {expect, use} from 'chai';
import {Contract} from 'ethers';
import {deployContract, MockProvider, solidity} from 'ethereum-waffle';
import EtherSplitter from '../build/EtherSplitter.json';

use(solidity);

describe('Ether Splitter', () => {
  const [sender, receiver1, receiver2] = new MockProvider().getWallets();
  let splitter: Contract;


  beforeEach(async () => {
    splitter = await deployContract(sender, EtherSplitter, [receiver1.address, receiver2.address]);
  });

  // we will be adding our tests here

});
```
Now let's examine what is happening in there. 
The ``MockProvider`` comes up with a local mock version of the blockchain. It also delivers mock wallets that will serve us for testing our contract. We can get up to ten wallets by calling ``getWallets()`` method on the provider. You can see that in our example we get three wallets - for the sender and for two receivers.

Next, we declare a variable called 'splitter' - this is our mock EtherSplitter contract. It is created ``beforeEach`` execution of a single test by ``deployContract`` method. This method simulates deployment of a contract from the wallet passed as the first parameter (sender's wallet in our case). It's worth noticing here that, by default, all the Wei passed during testing will come from the wallet that the contract was deployed from - again, sender's in our case. So, as the first argument we provide a wallet that will pay for the deployment. The second parameter is the ABI and bytecode of our contract - note that we provide a json file with compiled EtherSplitter contract. The third parameter is an array with the contract's contructor arguments, which in our case are the two addresses of receivers.

## ``changeBalances``

So let's create our first test! We will check if the split method actually changes the balances of our test wallets. If we passed 50 Wei to the split method (the Wei are taken from sender's wallet), we would expect balances of receiver1 and receiver2 to increse by 25 Wei. To test that case we will use Waffle's ``changeBalances`` matcher:
```ts
it('Changes accounts balances', async () => {
  await expect(() => splitter.split({value: 50}))
    .to.changeBalances([receiver1, receiver2], [25, 25]);
});
```
With ``changeBalances`` matcher as the first parameter, we pass an array of wallets which balances we want to check and as the second -  an array of increases on corresponding accounts. 
If we wanted to check the balance of one specific wallet we could also use ``changeBalance`` matcher as in example below:
```ts
it('Changes account balance', async () => {
  await expect(() => splitter.split({value: 50}))
    .to.changeBalance(receiver1, 25);
});
```
Note that in both cases of ``changeBalance`` and ``changeBalances`` we pass the split function as a callback, because the matcher needs to access the state of balances before and after the call.

Now we'll test if the Transfer event is emitted after each transfer of Wei. We'll turn to another matcher from Waffle - 
## ``Emit``
```ts
it('Emits event on transfer to first receiver', async () => {
  await expect(splitter.split({value: 50})).to.emit(splitter, 'Transfer')
    .withArgs(sender.address, receiver1.address, 25);
});

it('Emits event on transfer to second receiver', async () => {
  await expect(splitter.split({value: 50})).to.emit(splitter, 'Transfer')
    .withArgs(sender.address, receiver2.address, 25);
});
```
With the ``emit`` matcher we can check if a contract emitted particular event on calling some method. To that matcher we provide the mock contract that we predict to emit the event and the name of that event. In our case the mock contract is splitter and the name of event - Transfer. As we can see, we can also check precise arguments that the event was emmited with - we pass as many arguments to ``withArgs`` matcher, as many arguments accepts our event. In case of EtherSplitter contract we pass addresses of the sender and the receiver along with transferred Wei amount.
## ``revertedWith``
As the last example we'll perform checking if the transaction was reverted after sending uneven number of Wei to split. We'll use for that ``revertedWith`` matcher:
```ts
it('Reverts when Vei amount uneven', async () => {
    await expect(splitter.split({value: 51})).to.be.revertedWith('Uneven Wei amount not allowed');
});
```
Passing that test will assure us that transaction was indeed reverted. However there must be also exact match between the messages that we send while reverting (specified in ``require`` statement) and the message we expect in ``revertedWith``. If we go back to the code of EtherSplitter contract, in the ``require`` statement we provide the message: "Uneven Wei amount not allowed". That matches the message we expect in our test. If they were not equal, the test would fail.

**Congratulations! You've made your first big step towards testing smart contracts with Waffle like a pro!**
