# Adding Ethereum exchanges {#adding-ethereum-exchanges}

Anyone is free to suggest new exchanges on ethereum.org.

We currently list them on:

- ethereum.org/get-eth

They are part of a feature that allows a user to type in where they live and see what exchanges they can use. This helps surface any geographical restrictions early. 

Because of this context, we need some specific information when you suggest an exchange. 

**NOTE:** If you want to list a decentralized exchange, take a look at our [policy for listing wallets and dapps](/en/contributng/adding-products/).

## What we need {#what-we-need}

- The geographical restrictions that apply to the exchange
- The currencies I can use to buy ETH
- Proof that the exchange is a legitimate trading company
- Any additional information you might have â€“ this might be information about the company like years of operation, financial backing etc.

We need this info so that we can correctly list the exchange in our [exchange finder tool](/en/get-eth/#country-picker). 

And so that ethereum.org can be more confident that the exchange is a legitimate and safe service.
