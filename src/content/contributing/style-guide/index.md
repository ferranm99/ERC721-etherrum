# Ethereum.org Style Guide {#style-guide}

Content on [etheruem.org](/) is crowdsourced and primarily written by our incredible contributors. This style guide aims to standardize certain aspects of contributing content to make the contribution process smoother.

## Who can submit content to ethereum.org {#who-can-help}

Anyone! Ethereum.org is entirely open source, and many of its best pages are submitted by curious learners who expanded their notes into documentation pages now living on the site!

## Audience {#audience}

Ethereum.org content caters to a large and varied audience. Loosely we can categorize them as:

#### Individuals

App users, investors, enthusiasts, people who are "new to Ethereum"

#### Developers

Developers or others who want technical information about Ethereum.

#### Enterprises

People, businesses, and other organizations who want to understand Ethereum's value in an enterprise setting

Because ethereum.org caters to a wide variety of users, all content on the site should make an effort to explain any technologies and concepts as simply as possible.

## Objectivity {#objectivity}

Ethereum.org documentation aims to maintain a credibly neutral source of truth to inform readers about Ethereum and its ecosystem. Some examples of things that we don't want in the content on ethereum.org:

**Grand, unverifiable claims about Ethereum or adjacent technologies**

> e.g. _ "Ethereum will take over the world because..."_

**Hostile or confrontational language aimed at any organization or person**

> e.g. _ "Company X is bad because they are centralized!"_

**Politically charged rhetoric**

> e.g. _ "This political party is better for decentralization because..."_

## Tone {#tone}

The tone of the content on the site should be welcoming, friendly and authoritative. Where possible, jargon should be minimized and simple language used instead.

## Best Practices {#best-practices}

### Use American English {#american-english}

For words that have multiple spellings, use American English over British English.

**For example:**

- `decentralized` over `decentralised`
- `color` over `colour`
- `analyze` over `analyse`

### Acronyms {#acronyms}

When introducing an unfamiliar acronym, spell out the full term, and put the acronym in parentheses. Put both the full term and acronym in bold.

**For example:**

"Ethereum, like Bitcoin, currently uses a consensus protocol called **Proof-of-work (PoW)**."

### Consistency {#consistency}

Many of the topics covered on ethereum.org are technically complex. To reduce confusion to the reader, terms should be used consistently. For example, don't cycle back-and-forth between proof-of-work and PoW at random.

### Ethereum {#ethereum}

Ethereum is a proper noun and should always be capitalized.

- `Ethereum` not `ethereum`

### Ether {#ether}

Ether is a common noun and should not be capitalized unless at the beginning of a sentence. ETH, on the other hand, is a currency abbreviation and should always be capitalized.

- `ether` not `Ether`
- `ETH` not `eth or Eth`

### Mainnet {#mainnet}

When referring to the Ethereum Mainnet (i.e. not referring to a testnet) use the proper noun. Proper nouns help avoid confusion and build greater understanding.

**Correct usage:**

- Mainnet
- Ethereum Mainnet

**Incorrect usage:**

- main net
- mainnet
- Main net
- Ethereum mainnet

### Proof-of-work / Proof-of-stake {#proof-of}

Proof-of-work should be capitalized at the beginning of a sentence or when the term is introduced for the first time on a page, in any other instance, all letters should be lower case. In either case, proof-of-work should be hyphenated between each word.

**Correct usage:**

- Proof-of-work
- proof-of-work

**Incorrect usage:**

- Proof-of-Work
- Proof of work
- proof of work

The same rules we apply to proof-of-work are applicable to proof-of-stake.

**Correct usage:**

- Proof-of-stake
- proof-of-stake

**Incorrect usage:**

- Proof-of-Stake
- Proof of stake
- proof of stake

### Use Active Voice {#use-active-voice}

Sentences using active voice are more concise and efficient, making your writing more engaging and easier to comprehend.

**Active voice sentence:** an actor acts on a target

> _ "The man bought a car."_

**Passive voice sentence:** a target acts on an actor

> _ "The car was bought by a man."_

_This isn't an easy one, especially for non-native English speakers. If you aren't sure, don't worry. We'll help with any of these._

### Linking to internal pages {#internal-links}

When linking to another page on Ethereum.org, use the relative path over the absolute path. Do not hard-code the language path (i.e. `/en`) in any links. This maintains consistency across different language versions of the site and ensures links work correctly in local development.

```md
<!-- Good -->

<!-- Bad -->

```

### Linking to images {#images}

When adding an image to a page, the image should be downloaded and placed in the same folder as the markdown file. You can reference the image like this:

`![alt text for image](./image.png)`

```md
<!-- Good -->

<!-- Bad -->

```

### Using Emojis {#images}

Everyone loves emojis <Emoji text="ü•∞" size={1} /> To standardize the appearance of all Emojis across browsers ethereum.org uses an `Emoji` component.

```md
<--- Good --->

The London Upgrade is live <Emoji text=":heart:" size={1} />

The London Upgrade is live <Emoji text="‚ù§Ô∏è" size={1} />

<--- Bad --->

The London Upgrade is live ‚ù§Ô∏è
```

## Anything else? {#anything-else}

Like everything on ethereum.org, the style guide is an open-source work-in-progress with room for improvement. If there is anything you think should be added to improve this document please [edit it on GitHub](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website/blob/dev/src/content/contributing/style-guide/index.md).
