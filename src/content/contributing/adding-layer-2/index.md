# Adding layer 2s {#adding-layer-2}

We want to make sure we list the best resources possible so users can navigate the layer 2 space in a safe and confident manner.

If there's a layer 2 that we have missed, **please suggest it!**

We currently list them on:

- [Optimistic rollups](/developers/docs/scaling/optimistic-rollups/)
- [Zk rollups](/developers/docs/scaling/zk-rollups/)
<!-- TODO: Add layer-2 page -->

## How we decide {#how-we-decide}

Layer 2 submissions will be assessed by the following criteria:

**[Listing on L2BEAT](https://l2beat.com)**

- In order to be considered we need this project to be featured on L2BEAT. This resource provides a great risk assessment of layer 2 projects. **If the project is not featured on L2BEAT, they will not be considered for ethereum.org.**

**Is the project open source?**

**What kind of layer 2 is it?**

- Optimistic
- ZK
- State channel

**Bridges**

- How are users able to onboard to the layer 2?

**Exchange support**

- Are users able to deposit directly from an exchange?

**Links to dapps in the layer 2 ecosystem**

- We want to be able to provide information on what users can expect to be able to do on this layer 2.

**Token contract lists**

- Since assets will have a new address on layer 2, if there is a token list resource available please share.

**How long has the layer 2 been live?**

**Is the project a fork?**

- If the layer 2 is a fork, what project is it a fork of?

**What wallets can users use to access this layer 2?**

- Can users just import an RPC? What is that RPC?
- What wallets natively support this layer 2?

**Has the project been externally audited?**

- Include links to report and/or repo.

**TVL history of the layer 2**

- We want to see sustained adoption of the network, so if it is only being used short term for uses like yield farming and then liquidity leaves, we will take this into consideration when choosing to accept a project or not.

**Is the project being actively maintained?**

- We won't list layer 2s that don't have an active team supporting the project.
