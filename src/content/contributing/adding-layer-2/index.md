# Adding layer 2s {#adding-layer-2}

We want to make sure we list the best resources possible so users can navigate the layer 2 space in a safe and confident manner.

If there's a layer 2 that we have missed, **please suggest it!**

We currently list them on:

- [Optimistic rollups](/developers/docs/scaling/optimistic-rollups/)
- [Zk rollups](/developers/docs/scaling/zk-rollups/)
<!-- TODO: Add layer-2 page -->

## How we decide {#how-we-decide}

Layer 2 submissions will be assessed by the following criteria:

**[Listing on L2BEAT](https://l2beat.com)**

- In order to be considered we need this project to be featured on L2BEAT. This resource provides a great risk assessment of layer 2 projects. **If the project is not featured on L2BEAT, they will not be considered for ethereum.org.**

**Is the project open source?**

**What kind of layer 2 is it?**

- Optimistic
- ZK
- State channel

**Bridges**

- How are users able to onboard to the layer 2?

**Exchange support**

- Are users able to deposit directly from an exchange?

**Links to dapps in the layer 2 ecosystem**

- We want to be able to provide information on what users can expect to be able to do on this layer 2.

**Token contract lists**

- Since assets will have a new address on layer 2, if there is a token list resource available please share.

**How long has the layer 2 been live?**

**Is the project a fork?**

- If the layer 2 is a fork, what project is it a fork of?

**What wallets can users use to access this layer 2?**

- What is the public RPC information for the network? (RPC URL, Chain ID, Currency Symbol, Block Explorer URL)
- What wallets natively support this layer 2?

**Has the project been externally audited?**

- Include links to report and/or repo.

**Is the layer 2 widely used?**

- We will consider metrics such as TVL history, transaction statistics, and whether it is used by known companies or projects

**Is the project being actively maintained?**

- We won't list layer 2s that don't have an active team supporting the project.

**Is there a block explorer?**
