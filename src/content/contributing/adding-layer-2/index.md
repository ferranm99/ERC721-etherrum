# Adding layer 2s {#adding-layer-2}

We want to make sure we list the best resources possible so users can navigate the layer 2 space in a safe and confident manner.

Anyone is free to suggest adding a layer 2 on ethereum.org. If there's a layer 2 that we have missed, **please suggest it!**

We currently list L2s on the following pages:

- [Optimistic rollups](/developers/docs/scaling/optimistic-rollups/)
- [Zero-knowledge rollups](/developers/docs/scaling/zk-rollups/)
<!-- TODO: Add layer-2 page -->

Layer 2 is a relatively new and exciting paradigm for Ethereum. We've tried to create a fair framework for consideration on ethereum.org but the listing criteria will change and evolve over time.

## Information we require {#information-we-require}

Layer 2 submissions will be assessed by the following criteria:

**[Listing on L2BEAT](https://l2beat.com)**

- In order to be considered, this project must be featured on L2BEAT. L2BEAT provides a great risk assessment of layer 2 projects that we lean on for evaluating L2 projects. **If the project is not featured on L2BEAT, we will not list them as an L2 on ethereum.org.**

[Learn how to add your L2 project to L2BEAT](https://github.com/l2beat/l2beat/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

**Is the project open source?**

**What category of layer 2 is it?**

- Optimistic rollup
- Zero-knowledge rollup
- State channel

**Which bridges are used to onboard?**

- How are users able to onboard to the layer 2?

**Which exchanges offer support for the project?**

- Are users able to deposit and/or withdraw directly from an exchange? If yes, which exchanges?

**Links to dapps in the layer 2 ecosystem**

- We want to be able to provide information on what users can expect to be able to do on this layer 2. (ex: https://portal.arbitrum.one/, https://www.optimism.io/apps/all)

**Token contract lists**

- Since assets will have a new address on layer 2, if there is a token list resource available please share.

**How long has the layer 2 been live?**

**Is the project a fork?**

- If the layer 2 is a fork, which project was forked?

**What wallets can users use to access this layer 2?**

- What is the public RPC information for the network? (RPC URL, Chain ID, Currency Symbol, Block Explorer URL)
- What wallets natively support this layer 2?

**Has this project undergone an external security audit or bug bounty?**

- Include links to any reports and/or repos.

**Has the project maintained its users over time?**

- We will consider metrics such as TVL history, transaction statistics, and whether it is used by known companies or projects

**Is the project being actively maintained?**

- We won't list a layer 2 that doesn't have an active team working on project.

**Is there a block explorer?**

- Please provide a link to the block explorer.
