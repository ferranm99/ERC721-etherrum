# Adding Products

Anyone is free to suggest new wallets and dapps to the content on ethereum.org, where it's appropriate to do so. **No, we won't list your dapp on our homepage** ðŸ˜œ

We currently list wallets and dapps on:

- ethereum.org/wallets
- ethereum.org/dapps

**Please only suggest new additions on these pages.**

Although we welcome new additions, we chose the current wallets and dapps based on an experience we're trying to create for our users. These are based on some of our design principles:

- Inspirational: we want what we list to offer something new to users
- A good story: we want what we list to provide an "aha" moment
- Credible: we want what we list to be legitimate businesses/projects to minimise risk to users

Overall **we want to provide a "seamless onboarding experience" for new users**. So for that reason, we add wallets/dapps based on their:

- ease of use
- interoperability with other products
- security
- longevity

Here's our decision framework in more detail. Please feel free to provide feedback or suggest changes.

## How we decide

### Criteria for inclusion: the must-haves

- **An audited product** â€“ this shows us that you take your code and your user's security seriously and reduces the risk to our users
- **A product** **that has been "live" for over 6 months** (live might mean on main net for smart contract wallets) â€“ this is another indication of security. We believe 6 months is a good timeframe for critical bugs and exploitations to have been found.
- **Worked on by an active, funded team** â€“ this helps ensure quality and that a user will get support with their queries.

### Criteria for ranking: the nice-to-haves

If we add your dapp or wallet it may not be listed as prominently as others. This is because we also consider the following criteria when designing our pages.

**Wallets**

---

- **Fiat onramps** â€“ this prevents a lot of potential friction in a new user's experience with a wallet. If we send users to a wallet that they need to fund via an exchange, it can be days before they can try the wallet, based on KYC times.
- **Supported by majority of dapps** â€“ our content aims to get users up and running with a wallet and eth before showing them dapps. If dapps don't support connecting with your wallet, it could ruin their experience.

**Dapps**

---

- **You can access it via the majority of wallets we list** â€“ this means the wallets we suggest to users will work for dapps we suggest too
- **Users can try it out themselves â€“** we're not going to list your supply chain b2b app because users can't just try it out. An individual user should be able to use your dapp and achieve something tangible.

**Both**

---

- **Onboarding** â€“ you product should have a well-designed onboarding experience to help and educate users or evidence of how-to content (articles/youtube etc.)
- **Open source** â€“ your code should be accessible and you should accept PRs from the wider community
- **Community** â€“ you have a dedicated community, maybe a discord where users can interact with your team to get help, suggest new features etc.

## Criteria in practice

The more of the criteria you fill, the more likely we'll list your product.

A product we list that only meets the must-haves may be removed if a new product is suggested that meets the must-haves and several of the nice-to-haves.

Other things that will factor into this decision:

- Will adding rather than replacing break the UX of the page?
  - our site is primarily educational and the main purpose is to explain Ethereum and its relevant concepts. By adding too many options for users to click on we'll end up making our pages less readable and thus less useful.
- Does this page now paralyse the user with choices?
  - like when you sit browsing netflix for hours because you can't decide something to watch. We don't want to bamboozle users that are new to Ethereum by giving them too much choice.

This is a design decision that we alone are responsible for.

But rest assured, even if we don't list your product, **we'll provide prominent links to other websites in the ecosystem that rank all dapps/wallets for users that want to see more choices.**

## Maintenance

As is the fluid nature of Ethereum, teams and products come and go and innovation happens daily, so we'll undertake routine checks of our content to:

- ensure that all wallets and dapps we list still fulfil our criteria.
- there aren't products that have been suggested that meet more of our criteria than the ones currently listed

You can help with this by checking and letting us know if we should update.

We're also investigating options for voting so the community can indicate their preferences and highlight the best products out there for us to recommend.
