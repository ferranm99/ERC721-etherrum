summary: Sharding is a multi-phase upgrade to improve Ethereum’s scalability and capacity. It involves spreading Ethereum’s load across many new chains to increase the amount of transactions Ethereum can handle per second and decrease the computational burden on those validating the transactions.

# What’s different about shard chains?

shard chains’s role will change over time but it’s a foundational component for the secure, sustainable and scalable Ethereum we’re aiming towards.

shard chains isn’t like the Ethereum mainnet of today. It doesn’t have accounts and it can’t handle smart contracts. It’s role is to conduct or coordinate the network.

## What’s in the upgrade?

### Introducing staking

shard chains will introduce the concept of staking to Ethereum. This will allow you to put your ETH towards securing the network. Think of this like a public good that will make Ethereum healthier and earn you more ETH in the process. In practice, it will involve you staking ETH in order to run software that keeps Ethereum going. With this software you’ll be processing transactions and creating new blocks in the chain.

This is a lot easier to do than how the network is currently secured: mining.

This extra accessibility will help make Ethereum more secure in the long run. The more people that participate in the network, the more decentralized and secure it will become.

This is also an important change for the second ETH2 upgade: shard chains.

### Setting up for shard chains

Shard chains will be the second Eth2 upgrade. They’ll increase the capacity of network and improve transaction speed by extending the network to 64 blockchains. shard chains is an important first step in introducing shard chains, because they require staking to work securely.

Eventually shard chains will also be responsible for randomly assigning stakers to validate shard chains. This is key to ensuring stakers can’t become bad guys and collude to take over a shard. Well, it means they have less than a 1 in a trillion chance. This is where shard chains’s coordination role comes into play.
