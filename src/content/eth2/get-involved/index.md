# Get involved in Eth2

People from all across the Ethereum community have been contributing to Eth2, and there are ways for you to get involved too. At this stage, most of the ways to help out are quite technical because the work is focussed on testing. But there'll be more less-technical opportunities to get involved with Eth2 as we get further along [the roadmap](/en/eth2/roadmap/).

## Go bug hunting üêõ {#go-bug-hunting}

To find and report bugs in Eth2 you'll need to run the test clients and see if you can find anything that doesn't work properly.

A bug might be a severe defect that could crash Eth2 or just something that doesn't quite work as you think it should. This is a vital part of making sure the [beacon chain](/en/eth2/the-beacon-chain) works as designed. You can get rewards for bringing bugs to the community's attention ‚Äì for more details check out [the bounty program](https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/phase0-bounty)

**If you can, it's even more helpful to set up and run multiple Eth2 clients.**

## Attacknets ü§∫

Security is everything. If you're a white-hat hacker you can help out by trying to crash purpose-made attacknets. They are small, four-node versions of the Lighthouse and Prysm clients. Bringing down one of these attacknets could shine a light on potential vulnerabilities in the real thing.

There are ETH and DAI rewards for successful attacks that help us improve the security of Eth2.

## Stake test ETH using the launchpad üöÄ

As a holder of ETH, you can now participate in the test version of Eth2 by staking test ETH. This will make you a test Eth2 validator. A validator is someone who runs software that processes transactions and creates new blocks in Eth2 ‚Äì potentially earning rewards in the process.

This test staking is happening on the [Medalla multi-client testnet](https://github.com/goerli/medalla/blob/master/medalla/README.md) using G√∂ETH, a type of test ETH running on the G√∂rli testnet. The staking launchpad will walk you through the process in detail.

If you don't have any G√∂ETH, you can get some from the [G√∂rli faucet](https://faucet.goerli.mudit.blog/). This is an application that allows you to request test ETH.
