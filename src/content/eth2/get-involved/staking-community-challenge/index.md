# Eth2 Staking Community Grants {#Eth2-staking-community-grants}

_The Ethereum Foundation is sponsoring a wave of Eth2 staking community grants. Proposals are due December 22, 2020. Here are all the details you need._

<Divider />

Calling all those interested in building up the Eth2 staking and validator community!

Eth2 is happening! The mainnet [deposit contract address](/eth2/deposit-contract/) is deployed. And [genesis of the Beacon Chain](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/genesis) is [right around the corner](https://blog.ethereum.org/2020/11/04/eth2-quick-update-no-19/). Which means, stakers are gearing up to stake.

The Ethereum Foundation is funding the creation of tools, documentation, and resources to make for a delightful staking and validator experience. While the spirited staker ecosystem has already made great progress with respect to public good community resources, we are still in the early days and there's more work to do!

## Open call for projects {#open-call}

The initiative is open to staking-related ideas and projects at any stage of development:

- Idea phase.
- Proof of concept.
- Work in progress.
- Fleshed out project.

The aim is to support consistent and ongoing work that builds up the Eth2 staking ecosystem over time.

The open call centers around three core categories:

- Staking education and community
- Staking and validator tools
- Data analysis and visualizations

### Examples {#examples}

- Are you building end-to-end staking guides for different clients on various platforms?
- Are you writing crisp, clear staking documentation?
- Are you teaching stakers of all levels, from beginner to advanced, through video and written tutorials?
- Are you building a staking wiki focused on best practices and security? What novel ways can you dream up to encourage people to contribute?
- Are you experimenting with sophisticated staking setups and detailing out guides/tools for the community to reproduce and understand tradeoffs?
- What engaging diagrams or illustrations of the Beacon Chain are you creating?
- How can you make it easier to retrieve live data from the Beacon Chain?
- What data analyses and visualizations can give stakers live insights into the network?
- What new staking tools are you building?

Other topic areas are welcome too! Be it research, testing frameworks, infographics, and so on. The point of the program is to help contribute to the long term health of the Eth2 staking and validator community. If your proposal advances this aim, tell us about it!

In addition to the prompt questions above, here's a wishlist of avenues to explore.

   <p>
    If you're new to staking, we encourage you to practice first on a testnet before moving to mainnet. Follow the steps to set up a validator on the Medalla testnet via <Link to="https://medalla.launchpad.ethereum.org/">the Medalla launchpad</Link>.
   </p>
   <p>
    Once you're ready for mainnet, head on over to <Link to="http://launchpad.ethereum.org/">the official launchpad</Link> to set up your Eth2 validator.
