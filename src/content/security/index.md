## How to Stay Safe

With interest in cryptocurrencies growing exponentially, learning best practices when using cryptocurrency is essential. Crypto can be fun and exciting, but there are also serious risks. You can mitigate these risks with a small amount of upfront work.

## Web Security 101

### Use strong passwords

Over 80% of account hacks are a result of weak or stolen passwords. A long combination of characters, numbers and symbols is best to keep your accounts secure.

A common mistake individuals make is using a long combination of common dictionary words. Passwords like this are insecure because they are prone to a simple hacking technique known as a [dictionary attack](<[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_attack)>).

Example of a weak password: FluffyKittens!

Example of a strong password: ymv\*azu.EAC8eyp8umf
```

#### Good password practices:

- Make passwords **at least** 12 characters long
- Use a mixture of uppercase, lowercase, numbers and symbols
- Avoid common dictionary words

### Use unique passwords for everything

A strong password doesn't provide as much protection if the password is revealed in a data breach. The website [Have I Been Pwned](<notion://www.notion.so/efdn/%5B%3Chttps://haveibeenpwned.com/%3E%5D(%3Chttps://haveibeenpwned.com/%3E)>) allows you to check if your accounts were involved in any data breaches stored in their database. If they have, **you should change pwned passwords immediately**. Using unique passwords for every account lowers the risk of hackers getting access to all of your accounts when one of your passwords is compromised.

### Use a password manager

Remembering strong, unique passwords for every account you have isn't ideal. A password manager offers a secure, encrypted store for all your passwords that you can access through one strong master password. They also suggest strong passwords when signing up for a new service, so you don't have to create your own. Many password managers will also tell you if you have been involved in a data breach, allowing you to change the passwords before any malicious attacks.

#### Try a password manager:

- [LastPass](<[https://www.lastpass.com/](https://www.lastpass.com/)>)
- [1Password](<[https://1password.com/](https://1password.com/)>)
- [KeePass](<[https://keepass.info/](https://keepass.info/)>)

### Use Two-Factor Authentication

Using **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** provides an additional *security factor* for your online accounts so that knowing your password alone is not enough to access an account. Most commonly, this is a randomised 6-digit code that you can access through an authenticator app.

For the best security, use a service like <a href='https://mashable.com/article/how-to-set-up-google-authenticator'>Google Authenticator</a> or <a href='https://authy.com/'>Authy</a>.

### Uninstall browser extentions

Browser extensions like Chrome extensions or Add-ons for Firefox can augment useful browser functionality and improve user experience, but they come with risks. By default, most browser extensions ask for access to 'read and change site data', allowing them to do almost anything with your data. Chrome extensions are always automatically updated, so a previously safe extension may update later to include malicious code. Most browser extensions are not trying to steal your data, but you should be aware that they can.

#### Stay safe by:

- Only install browser extensions from trusted sources
- Removing unused browser extensions
- Install Chrome extensions locally to stop auto-updating (Advanced)
