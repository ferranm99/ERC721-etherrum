NFTs are currently taking the digital art and collectibles world by storm. Digital artists are seeing their lives change thanks to huge sales to a new crypto-audience. And celebrities are joining in as they spot a new opportunity to connect with fans.

Here's what you need to know about NFTs.

## What's an NFT?

NFTs are tokens that we can use to represent a record of ownership. They let us tokenise art, collectibles, even purely physical items like designer trainers/sneakers. They can only have one owner at a time and they're protected by the Ethereum blockchain ‚Äì no one can modify the record of ownership or copy/paste a new NFT into existence.

_If Andy Warhol had been born in the late 90s, he probably would have minted Campbell's Soup as an NFT. It's only a matter of time before Kanye puts a run of Yeezys on Ethereum. And one day owning your car and your rental agreement might be managed with NFTs._

### Examples

THe NFT world is relatively new. In theory, the scope for NFTs is anything that is unique that needs provable ownership. Here are some examples of NFTs that exist today, to help you get the idea:

- A unique digital artwork.
- #23/#100 of a limited edition run of designer sneakers.
- An in-game item.
- An essay.
- A digital collectible like a trading card.

## How do NFTs work?

NFTs have some special properties:

- each token is unique.
- they're not interchangeable with another NFT in the same run.
- each token has an owner and this information is easily verifiable.
- you can't own a % of an NFT token in the same way you can own 0.0001 ETH.
- they live on Ethereum, so are compatible with every single NFT market on Ethereum.

In other words, if you own an NFT:

- only you own it.
- you can easily prove you own it.
- no one can manipulate it in any way.
- you can sell it on, and in some cases this will earn the original creator a % of resale royalties.

And if you create an NFT:

- you can easily prove you're the creator.
- you determine the scarcity.
- you can earn royalties every time it's sold.
- you can sell it on any NFT market or peer-to-peer. You're not locked in to any platform and you don't need anyone to intermediate.

## Ethereum and NFTs

Ethereum is the perfect foundation for NFTs for a number of reasons:

- Transaction history and token metadata is publicly verifiable ‚Äì it's simple to prove ownership history.
- Once a transaction is confirmed, it's nearly impossible to manipulate that data to "steal" ownership.
- Trading NFTs can happen peer-to-peer without needing platforms that can take large cuts as compensation.
- All Ethereum products share the same "backend". Put another way, all Ethereum products can easily understand each other ‚Äì this makes NFTs portable across products. You can buy an NFT on one product and sell it on another easily. As a creator you can list your NFTs on multiple products at the same time ‚Äì every product will have the most up-to-date ownership information.
- Ethereum never goes down, meaning your tokens will always be available to sell.

## NFT use cases

### Digital media

The biggest use of NFTs today is in the digital content realm. That's because that industry today is broken. Content creators see their profits and earning potential swallowed by platforms.

An artist publishing work on a social network makes money for the platform who sell ads to the artists followers. They get exposure in return, but exposure doesn't pay the bills.

NFTs powers a new creator economy where creators don't hand ownership of their content over to the platforms they use to publicise it. Ownership is baked into the content itself.

When they sell their content, funds go directly to them. If the new owner was to go on and re-sell the NFT, the original creator can even get a % because the creator address is part of the token's metadata ‚Äì metadata which can't be modified.

#### The copy/paste problem

Naysayers often bring up the fact that NFTs "are dumb" usually alongside a picture of them screenshotting an NFT artwork. "Look, now I have that image for free!" they say smugly.

Well, yes. But does googling an image of Picasso's Guernica make you the proud new owner of a multi-million dollar piece of art history?

Ultimately owning the real thing is as valuable as the market makes it. The more a piece of content is screen-grabbed, shared, and generally used the more value it gains.

Owning the verifiably real thing will always have more value than not.
