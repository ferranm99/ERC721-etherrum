NFTs are currently taking the digital art and collectibles world by storm. Digital artists are seeing their lives change thanks to huge sales to a new crypto-audience. And celebrities are joining in as they spot a new opportunity to connect with fans. But digital art is only one way to use NFTs. Really they can be used to represent ownership of any unique asset, like a deed for an item in the digital or physical realm.

_If Andy Warhol had been born in the late 90s, he probably would have minted Campbell's Soup as an NFT. It's only a matter of time before Kanye puts a run of Yeezys on Ethereum. And one day owning your car might be managed with NFTs._

<InfoBanner isWarning>NOTE: we don't currently explain the problems NFTs solve. On defi we talk about the problems with the tradfi system and on daos we talk about tthe difficulties of trusting strangers. The internet today isn't set up for ownership, but how can we easily explain this?</InfoBanner>

## What's an NFT? {#what-are-nfts}

NFTs are tokens that we can use to represent a record of ownership. They let us tokenise unique items like art, collectibles, even real estate. They can only have one owner at a time and they're protected by the Ethereum blockchain – no one can modify the record of ownership or copy/paste a new NFT into existence.

NFT stands for non-fungible token. Non-fungible is an economic term that you could use to describe things like your furniture, a song file, or your computer. These things are not exchangeable for other items because they have unique properties.

Fungibile items on the other hand can be exchanged as their value defines them rather than their unique properties. For example ETH is fungible because 1 ETH is exchangeable for another ETH.

### NFT examples {#nft-examples}

The NFT world is relatively new. In theory, the scope for NFTs is anything that is unique that needs provable ownership. Here are some examples of NFTs that exist today, to help you get the idea:

- A unique digital artwork.
- A unique shirt in a limited-run fashion line.
- An in-game item.
- [An essay](https://zora.co/0x517bab7661C315C63C6465EEd1b4248e6f7FE183/145).
- [A digital collectible](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks/details/1).
- [A domain name](https://app.ens.domains/name/ethereum.eth)
- A ticket that gives you access to an event or a coupon – these items are often known as semi-fungible. They are fungible until they are redeemed, at which point they can't be traded for a non-redeemed version.

### ethereum.org examples {#ethereum-org-examples}

We've used NFTs to give back to our contributors and store our website outside of centralized servers.

#### POAPs (Proof of attendance protocol) {#poaps}

If you contribute to ethereum.org, you can claim a POAP NFT. These are collectibles that prove you participated in an event. Some crypto meetups have used POAPs as a form of ticket to their events. [More on contributing](/contributing/#poap).

#### ethereum.eth {#ethereum-dot-eth}

This website is accessible via the ethereum.eth ENS (Ethereum name service) name. With the content hosted on IPFS, a decentralized storage solution, this website is actually an NFT.

- [ENS record](https://app.ens.domains/name/ethereum.eth)
- [IPFS link](https://ethereum.eth.link/) – _the content hosted on IPFS is currently an older version of this site. So, ethereum.eth is an NFT of a historical version of this site!_

## How do NFTs work? {#how-nfts-work}

[TALK ABOUT RELATIONSHIP WITH IPFS SOMEWHERE]

NFTs have some special properties:

- each token is unique.
- they're not interchangeable with another NFT. For example 1 ETH is exactly the same as another ETH. This isn't the case with NFTs.
- each token has an owner and this information is easily verifiable.
- they live on Ethereum, so are compatible with every single NFT market on Ethereum.

In other words, if you own an NFT:

- you can easily prove you own it.
- no one can manipulate it in any way.
- you can sell it on, and in some cases this will earn the original creator a % of resale royalties.

And if you create an NFT:

- you can easily prove you're the creator.
- you determine the scarcity.
- you can earn royalties every time it's sold.
- you can sell it on any NFT market or peer-to-peer. You're not locked in to any platform and you don't need anyone to intermediate.

## What are NFTs used for? {#nft-use-cases}

### Maximising earnings for creators {#nfts-for-creators}

The biggest use of NFTs today is in the digital content realm. That's because that industry today is broken. Content creators see their profits and earning potential swallowed by platforms.

An artist publishing work on a social network makes money for the platform who sell ads to the artists followers. They get exposure in return, but exposure doesn't pay the bills.

NFTs powers a new creator economy where creators don't hand ownership of their content over to the platforms they use to publicise it. Ownership is baked into the content itself.

When they sell their content, funds go directly to them. If the new owner was to go on and re-sell the NFT, the original creator can even automatically receive royalties because the creator address is part of the token's metadata – metadata which can't be modified.

#### The copy/paste problem {#nfts-copy-paste}

Naysayers often bring up the fact that NFTs "are dumb" usually alongside a picture of them screenshotting an NFT artwork. "Look, now I have that image for free!" they say smugly.

Well, yes. But does googling an image of Picasso's Guernica make you the proud new owner of a multi-million dollar piece of art history?

Ultimately owning the real thing is as valuable as the market makes it. The more a piece of content is screen-grabbed, shared, and generally used the more value it gains.

Owning the verifiably real thing will always have more value than not.

### Boosting gaming potential {#nft-gaming}

NFTs have seen a lot of interest from game developers. NFTs can provide records of ownership for in-game items, fuel in-game economies, and bring a host of benefits to the players.

In a lot of regular games you can purchase items for you to use in your game. But if that item was an NFT you could recoup your money by selling it on when you're done with the game. You might even make a profit if that item becomes more desirable.

For game developers – as issuers of the NFT – they could earn a royalty every time an item is re-sold in the open marketplace. This creates a more mutually-beneficial business model where both players and developers earn from the secondary NFT market.

This also means that if a game is no longer maintained by the developers, the items you've collected remain yours.

Ultimately the items you grind for in-game can outlive the games themselves. Even if a game is no longer maintained, your items will always be under your control. This means in-game items become digital memorabilia and have a value outside of the game.

Decentraland, a virtual reality game, even lets you buy NFTs representing virtual parcels of land that you can use as you see fit.

### Making ethereum addresses more memorable {#nft-domains}

The Ethereum Name Service uses NFTs to provide your Ethereum address with an easier-to-remember name like `mywallet.eth`. This means you could ask someone to send you ETH via `mywallet.eth` rather than `0x123456789.....`.

This works in a similar way to a website domain name which makes an IP address more memorable. And like domains, ENS names have value, usually based on length and relevance. With ENS you don't need a domain registry in order to facilitate the tranfer of ownership. Instead, ENS names can be traded on NFT marketplaces with ease.

### Physical items {#nft-physical-items}

The tokenisation of physical items isn't yet as developed as their digital counterparts. However there have been plenty of projects that have explored the tokenisation of real estate, one-of-a-kind fashion items, and more.

As NFTs are essentially deeds, one day you could buy a car or home using ETH and receive the deed as an NFT in return (in the same transaction). As things become increasingly high-tech, it's not hard to imagine a world where your Ethereum wallet becomes the key to your car or home as it would contain the cryptographic proof of ownership.

With valuable assets like cars and property representable on Ethereum, there's the opportunity to use NFTs as collateral in decentralized loans. This is particularly helpful if you're not cash or crypto-rich but own physical items of value. [More on DeFi](/defi/)

## NFTs and DeFi {#nfts-and-defi}

The NFT world and the [decentralized finance (DeFi)](/defi/) world are starting to collaborate in a number of interesting ways.

### NFT-backed loans {#nft-backed-loans}

There are DeFi applications that let you borrow money by using collateral. For example you collateralise 10 ETH so you can borrow 5000 DAI ([a stablecoin](/stablecoins/)). This guarantees that the lender gets paid back – if the borrower does't pay back the DAI, the collateral is sent to the lender. However not everyone has enough crypto for collateral.

Projects are beginning to explore using NFTs as collateral instead. Imagine you bought a rare CryptoPunk NFT back in the day – they can fetch $1000s at today's prices. By putting this up as collateral, you can access a loan with the same rule set. If you don't pay back the DAI, your CryptoPunk will be sent to the lender as collateral. This could eventually work with anything you tokenise as an NFT.

And this isn't hard on Ethereum, because both worlds (NFT and DeFi) share the same infrastructure.

### Fractional ownership {#fractional-ownership}

NFT creators can also create "shares" for their NFT. This gives investors and fans the opportunity to own a part of an NFT without having to buy the whole thing. This adds even more oppportunities for NFT minters and collectors alike.

- Fractionalised NFTs can be traded on [DEXs](/defi/#dex) like Uniswap, not just [NFT marketplaces](/dapps?category=collectibles). That means more buyers and sellers.
- An NFT's overall price can be defined by the price of its fractions.
- You have more of an opportunity to own and profit from items you care about. It's harder to be priced out of owning NFTs.

This is still experimental but you can learn more about fractional NFT ownership at the following exchanges:

- [NIFTEX](https://landing.niftex.com/)
- [NFTX](https://gallery.nftx.org/)

The first NFTs ever made, CryptoPunks can be pricey these days. These platforms allow you to own $PUNK which represents a share of a CryptoPunk NFT. And once you own $PUNK you become a shareholder in that NFT, meaning you should have a say in things like revenue sharing. It's very likely that one day soon owning a fraction of an NFT will enter you into a decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO) for managing that asset.

These are Ethereum-powered organisations that allow strangers, like global shareholders of an asset, to coordinate securely without necessarily having to trust the other people. That's because not a single penny can be spent without group approval.

As we mentioned, this is an emerging space. NFTs, DAOs, fractionalised tokens are all developing at different paces. But all their infrastructure exists and can work together easily because they all speak the same language: Ethereum. So watch this space.

## Ethereum and NFTs {#ethereum-and-nfts}

Ethereum is the perfect foundation for NFTs for a number of reasons:

- Transaction history and token metadata is publicly verifiable – it's simple to prove ownership history.
- Once a transaction is confirmed, it's nearly impossible to manipulate that data to "steal" ownership.
- Trading NFTs can happen peer-to-peer without needing platforms that can take large cuts as compensation.
- All Ethereum products share the same "backend". Put another way, all Ethereum products can easily understand each other – this makes NFTs portable across products. You can buy an NFT on one product and sell it on another easily. As a creator you can list your NFTs on multiple products at the same time – every product will have the most up-to-date ownership information.
- Ethereum never goes down, meaning your tokens will always be available to sell.

## Build with NFTs {#build-with-nfts}

Most NFTs are built using a consistent standard known as [ERC-721](/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/). However there is a newer ERC-1155 standard which aims to make NFTs more efficient, especially in the realm of gaming.
