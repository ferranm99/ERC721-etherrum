NFTs are currently taking the digital art and collectibles world by storm. Digital artists are seeing their lives change thanks to huge sales to a new crypto-audience. And celebrities are joining in as they spot a new opportunity to connect with fans. But digital art is only one way to use NFTs. Really they can be used to represent ownership of any unique asset, like a deed for an item in the digital or physical realm.

If Andy Warhol had been born in the late 90s, he probably would have minted Campbell's Soup as an NFT. It's only a matter of time before Kanye puts a run of Yeezys on Ethereum. And one day owning your car might be managed with NFTs.

## What's an NFT? {#what-are-nfts}

NFTs are tokens that we can use to represent ownership of unique items. They let us tokenise things like art, collectibles, even real estate. They can only have one official owner at a time and they're secured by the Ethereum blockchain – no one can modify the record of ownership or copy/paste a new NFT into existence.

NFT stands for non-fungible token. Non-fungible is an economic term that you could use to describe things like your furniture, a song file, or your computer. These things are not interchangeable for other items because they have unique properties.

Fungibile items on the other hand can be exchanged as their value defines them rather than their unique properties. For example ETH or dollars are fungible because 1 ETH / $1 USD is exchangeable for another ETH / $1 USD.

## The internet of assets {#internet-of-assets}

NFTs and Ethereum solve some of the problems that exist in the internet today. As everything becomes more digital, there's more of a need to replicate the properties of physical items online, like scarcity, uniqueness, and proof of ownership. Not to mention that digital items often only work in the context of their product. For example you can't sell a song you purchased on iTunes, or you can't exchange your Starbucks loyalty points for Amazon credit even if there's a market for it.

Here's how an internet of NFTs looks against the internet most of us use today looks...

### A comparison {#nft-comparison}

| The NFT internet                                                                                                                                                                                            | The internet today                                                                                                                                                         |

| NFTs are digitally unique, no two NFTs are the same.                                                                                                                                                        | A copy of a file, like an .mp3 or .jpg, is the same as the original.                                                                                                       |
| Every NFT must have an owner and this is of public record and easy for anyone to verify.                                                                                                                    | Ownership records of digital items are stored on servers controlled by institutions – you must take their word for it.                                                     |
| NFTs are compatible with anything built using Ethereum. An NFT ticket for an event can be traded on every Ethereum marketplace, for an entirely different NFT. You could trade a piece of art for a ticket! | Companies with digital items must build their own infrastructure. For example an app that issues digital tickets for events would have to build their own ticket exchange. |
| Content creators can sell their work anywhere and can access a global market.                                                                                                                               | Creators rely on the infrastructure and distribution of the platforms they use. These are often subject to terms of use and geographical restrictions.                     |
| Creators can retain ownership rights over their own work, and claim resale royalties directly.                                                                                                              | Platforms, such as music streaming services, retain the majority of profits from sales.                                                                                    |
| Items can be used in surprising ways. For example you can use digital artwork as collateral in a decentralised loan.                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                            |

### NFT examples {#nft-examples}

The NFT world is relatively new. In theory, the scope for NFTs is anything that is unique that needs provable ownership. Here are some examples of NFTs that exist today, to help you get the idea:

- A unique digital artwork.
- A unique shirt in a limited-run fashion line.
- An in-game item.
- [An essay](https://zora.co/0x517bab7661C315C63C6465EEd1b4248e6f7FE183/145).
- [A digital collectible](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks/details/1).
- [A domain name](https://app.ens.domains/name/ethereum.eth)
- A ticket that gives you access to an event or a coupon – these items are often known as semi-fungible. They are fungible until they are redeemed, at which point they can't be traded for a non-redeemed version.

### ethereum.org examples {#ethereum-org-examples}

We use NFTs to give back to our contributors and we've even got our own NFT domain name.

#### POAPs (Proof of attendance protocol) {#poaps}

If you contribute to ethereum.org, you can claim a POAP NFT. These are collectibles that prove you participated in an event. Some crypto meetups have used POAPs as a form of ticket to their events. [More on contributing](/contributing/#poap).

![ethereum.org POAP](../../assets/use-cases/poap.png)

#### ethereum.eth {#ethereum-dot-eth}

This website has an alternative domain name powered by NFTs, **ethereum.eth**. Our `.org` address is centrally managed by a domain name system (DNS) provider, whereas ethereum`.eth` is registered on Ethereum via the Ethereum Name Service (ENS). And its owned and managed by us. [Check our ENS record](https://app.ens.domains/name/ethereum.eth)

## How do NFTs work? {#how-nfts-work}

NFTs have some special properties:

- Each token minted has a unique identifier.
- They're not directly interchangeable with other tokens 1:1. For example 1 ETH is exactly the same as another ETH. This isn't the case with NFTs.
- Each token has an owner and this information is easily verifiable.
- They live on Ethereum, and despite two NFTs not necessarily being interchangeable in value, they can easily be traded, bought and sold on any Ethereum-based NFT market.

In other words, if you _own_ an NFT:

- You can easily prove you own it.
- No one can manipulate it in any way.
- You can sell it, and in some cases this will earn the original creator resale royalties.
- Or, you can hold it forever, resting comfortably knowing your asset is secured by your wallet on Ethereum.

And if you _create_ an NFT:

- You can easily prove you're the creator.
- You determine the scarcity.
- You can earn royalties every time it's sold.
- You can sell it on any NFT market or peer-to-peer. You're not locked in to any platform and you don't need anyone to intermediate.

## What are NFTs used for? {#nft-use-cases}

Here's more information of some of the better developed use-cases and visions for NFTs on Ethereum.

### Maximising earnings for creators {#nfts-for-creators}

The biggest use of NFTs today is in the digital content realm. That's because that industry today is broken. Content creators see their profits and earning potential swallowed by platforms.

An artist publishing work on a social network makes money for the platform who sell ads to the artists followers. They get exposure in return, but exposure doesn't pay the bills.

NFTs power a new creator economy where creators don't hand ownership of their content over to the platforms they use to publicise it. Ownership is baked into the content itself.

When they sell their content, funds go directly to them. If the new owner was to go on and re-sell the NFT, the original creator can even automatically receive royalties because the creator address is part of the token's metadata – metadata which can't be modified.

#### The copy/paste problem {#nfts-copy-paste}

Naysayers often bring up the fact that NFTs "are dumb" usually alongside a picture of them screenshotting an NFT artwork. "Look, now I have that image for free!" they say smugly.

Well, yes. But does googling an image of Picasso's Guernica make you the proud new owner of a multi-million dollar piece of art history?

Ultimately owning the real thing is as valuable as the market makes it. The more a piece of content is screen-grabbed, shared, and generally used the more value it gains.

Owning the verifiably real thing will always have more value than not.

#### Scarcity {#scarcity}

The creator of an NFT gets to decide the scarcity of their asset. Just because all NFTs have unique identifiers, does not mean all token representations have the same scarcity.

For example, consider a ticket to a sporting event. Just as the organizer of an event can chose how many tickets to sell, the creator of an NFT can decide how many replicas exist. Sometimes these are exact replicas, such as 5000 General Admission tickets. Sometimes several are minted that are very similar, but each slightly different, such as a ticket with an assigned seat. In another case, the creator may want to create an NFT where only one is minted as a special rare collectible.

In all of these cases, each NFT would still have a unique identifier (like a bar code on a traditional "ticket"), with only one owner. The intended scarcity of the NFT matters, and is up to the creator. A creator may intend to make each NFT completely unique in order to create scarcity, or have reasons to produce several thousand replicas. Remember, this information is all public.

### Boosting gaming potential {#nft-gaming}

NFTs have seen a lot of interest from game developers. NFTs can provide records of ownership for in-game items, fuel in-game economies, and bring a host of benefits to the players.

In a lot of regular games you can purchase items for you to use in your game. But if that item was an NFT you could recoup your money by selling it on when you're done with the game. You might even make a profit if that item becomes more desirable.

For game developers – as issuers of the NFT – they could earn a royalty every time an item is re-sold in the open marketplace. This creates a more mutually-beneficial business model where both players and developers earn from the secondary NFT market.

This also means that if a game is no longer maintained by the developers, the items you've collected remain yours.

Ultimately the items you grind for in-game can outlive the games themselves. Even if a game is no longer maintained, your items will always be under your control. This means in-game items become digital memorabilia and have a value outside of the game.

Decentraland, a virtual reality game, even lets you buy NFTs representing virtual parcels of land that you can use as you see fit.

### Making Ethereum addresses more memorable {#nft-domains}

The Ethereum Name Service uses NFTs to provide your Ethereum address with an easier-to-remember name like `mywallet.eth`. This means you could ask someone to send you ETH via `mywallet.eth` rather than `0x123456789.....`.

This works in a similar way to a website domain name which makes an IP address more memorable. And like domains, ENS names have value, usually based on length and relevance. With ENS you don't need a domain registry in order to facilitate the tranfer of ownership. Instead, ENS names can be traded on NFT marketplaces.

Your ENS name can:

- Receive cryptocurrency and other NFTs.
- Point to a decentralized website, like [ethereum.eth](https://ethereum.eth.link). [More on decentralizing your website](https://docs.ipfs.io/how-to/websites-on-ipfs/link-a-domain/#domain-name-service-dns)
- Store any arbitrary information, including profile information like email addresses and Twitter handles.

### Physical items {#nft-physical-items}

The tokenisation of physical items isn't yet as developed as their digital counterparts. However there have been plenty of projects that have explored the tokenisation of real estate, one-of-a-kind fashion items, and more.

As NFTs are essentially deeds, one day you could buy a car or home using ETH and receive the deed as an NFT in return (in the same transaction). As things become increasingly high-tech, it's not hard to imagine a world where your Ethereum wallet becomes the key to your car or home as it would contain the cryptographic proof of ownership.

With valuable assets like cars and property representable on Ethereum, there's the opportunity to use NFTs as collateral in decentralized loans. This is particularly helpful if you're not cash or crypto-rich but own physical items of value. [More on DeFi](/defi/)

<Divider />

### NFTs and DeFi {#nfts-and-defi}

The NFT world and the [decentralized finance (DeFi)](/defi/) world are starting to work together in a number of interesting ways.

#### NFT-backed loans {#nft-backed-loans}

There are DeFi applications that let you borrow money by using collateral. For example you collateralise 10 ETH so you can borrow 5000 DAI ([a stablecoin](/stablecoins/)). This guarantees that the lender gets paid back – if the borrower does't pay back the DAI, the collateral is sent to the lender. However not everyone has enough crypto to use as collateral.

Projects are beginning to explore using NFTs as collateral instead. Imagine you bought a rare CryptoPunk NFT back in the day – they can fetch $1000s at today's prices. By putting this up as collateral, you can access a loan with the same rule set. If you don't pay back the DAI, your CryptoPunk will be sent to the lender as collateral. This could eventually work with anything you tokenise as an NFT.

And this isn't hard on Ethereum, because both worlds (NFT and DeFi) share the same infrastructure.

#### Fractional ownership {#fractional-ownership}

NFT creators can also create "shares" for their NFT. This gives investors and fans the opportunity to own a part of an NFT without having to buy the whole thing. This adds even more oppportunities for NFT minters and collectors alike.

- Fractionalised NFTs can be traded on [DEXs](/defi/#dex) like Uniswap, not just [NFT marketplaces](/dapps?category=collectibles). That means more buyers and sellers.
- An NFT's overall price can be defined by the price of its fractions.
- You have more of an opportunity to own and profit from items you care about. It's harder to be priced out of owning NFTs.

This is still experimental but you can learn more about fractional NFT ownership at the following exchanges:

- [NIFTEX](https://landing.niftex.com/)
- [NFTX](https://gallery.nftx.org/)

In theory, this would unlock the possibility to do things like own a piece of a Picasso. You would become a shareholder in a Picasso NFT, meaning you would have a say in things like revenue sharing. It's very likely that one day soon owning a fraction of an NFT will enter you into a decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO) for managing that asset.

These are Ethereum-powered organisations that allow strangers, like global shareholders of an asset, to coordinate securely without necessarily having to trust the other people. That's because not a single penny can be spent without group approval.

As we mentioned, this is an emerging space. NFTs, DAOs, fractionalised tokens are all developing at different paces. But all their infrastructure exists and can work together easily because they all speak the same language: Ethereum. So watch this space.

## Ethereum and NFTs {#ethereum-and-nfts}

Ethereum makes it possible for NFTs to work for a number of reasons:

- Transaction history and token metadata is publicly verifiable – it's simple to prove ownership history.
- Once a transaction is confirmed, it's nearly impossible to manipulate that data to "steal" ownership.
- Trading NFTs can happen peer-to-peer without needing platforms that can take large cuts as compensation.
- All Ethereum products share the same "backend". Put another way, all Ethereum products can easily understand each other – this makes NFTs portable across products. You can buy an NFT on one product and sell it on another easily. As a creator you can list your NFTs on multiple products at the same time – every product will have the most up-to-date ownership information.
- Ethereum never goes down, meaning your tokens will always be available to sell.

## The environmental impact of NFTs {#environmental-impact-nfts}

NFTs are growing in popularity which means they're also coming under increased scrutiny – especially over their carbon footprint.

To clarify a few things:

- By pressing the button to create or buy an NFT you are not directly releasing carbon into the atmosphere.
- NFTs aren't directly increasing the carbon footprint of Ethereum.

Here's where things are going to get a little technical, but bear with us...

### Don't blame it on the NFTs

The whole NFT ecosystem works because Ethereum is decentralized and tamper-proof.

Decentralized meaning you and everyone else can verify you own something without trusting or granting custody to a centralized third party who can impose their own rules at will. It also means your NFT is portable across many different products and markets.

Tamper-proof meaning no one can copy/paste your NFT or steal it.

These qualities of Ethereum makes digitally owning unique items and monetising your content fairly possible.

Blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum are energy intensive right now because it takes a lot of energy to preserve these qualities. If it was easy to rewrite Ethereum's history to steal NFTs or cryptocurrency, the system collapses.

<!-- [Need: how do centralized systems do this and why is it worse?]
 -->

#### NFTs and mining

When you mint an NFT, a few things have to happen:

- it needs to be confirmed as an asset on the blockchain.
- the owner's account balance must be updated to include that asset. This makes it possible for it to then be traded or verifiably "owned".
- the transactions that confirm the above need to be added to a block and "immortalised" on the chain.
- the block needs to be confirmed by everyone in the network as "correct". This consensus is what makes it possible for NFT creators to maximise their earnings – there are no intermediaries needed.

These tasks are done by miners. And they let the rest of the network know about your NFT and who owns it. This means mining needs to be sufficiently difficult, otherwise anyone could just claim that they own the NFT you just minted and fraudulently transfer ownership. There are lots of incentives in place to make sure miners are acting honestly.

[More on mining](/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow/)

Mining difficulty comes from the fact that it takes a lot of computing power to create new blocks in the chain. Importantly, blocks are created consistently, not just when they're needed. They're created every 12 seconds or so.

This is important for making Ethereum tamper-proof, one of the qualities that makes NFTs possible. The more blocks the more secure the chain. If your NFT was created in block #600 and a hacker were to try and change themselves to the creator of your NFT, it would immediately change the digital fingerprint of all subsequent blocks, #601, #602, #603, and so on. That means anyone running Ethereum software would immediately be able to tell and prevent it from happening.

However this means that computing power needs to be used constantly. It also means that a block that contains 0 NFT transactions will still have roughly the same carbon footprint, because computing power will still be consumed to create it. Other non-NFT transactions will fill the blocks.

So yes, there is a carbon footprint associated with creating blocks by mining – and this is a problem for chains like Bitcoin too – but it's not directly the fault of NFTs.

A lot of mining is done using renewable energy sources or untapped energy in remote locations. And there is the argument that the industries that NFTs and cryptocurrencies are disrupting have huge carbon footprints too. But just because existing industries are bad, doesn't mean we shouldn't strive to be better.

And we are. Ethereum is going through some upgrades to make using Ethereum (and by virtue, NFTs) more energy efficient. And that's always been the plan.

### A greener future...

For as long as Ethereum has been around, the energy-consumption of mining has been a huge focus area for developers and researchers. And the vision has always been to replace it as soon as possible.

[More on Ethereum's vision](/eth2/vision/)

This vision is being delivered right now.

#### The end goal: Eth2

Ethereum is currently going through a series of upgrades, known as Eth2, that will replace mining with [staking](/staking/). This will remove computing power as a security mechanism, and reduce Ethereum's carbon footprint by several orders of magnitude. Stakers commit funds instead of computing power to secure the network. Importantly this improves the energy efficiency while preserving the decentralization and security. Many other blockchains out there might already use some form of staking, but they might be secured by a select few stakers, not the 1000s that Ethereum will have. The more decentralization, the more secure the system.

[More on Eth2](/eth2/)

#### Rollups in the meantime...

While we wait for Eth2, products are moving to a "layer 2" technology known as rollups. Working on top of Ethereum, this technology lets you "roll up" or batch many transactions into a single one that is submitted to the chain. By moving as many things off the chain and only submitting the truly important bits (the cryptographic proofs), demand for block space will decrease. This will in turn lower the amount of computing power needed to create new blocks.

[More on rollups and layer 2 technology](/developers/docs/layer-2-scaling/)

#### A more efficient NFT standard...

Ethereum is open source software and new standards are being figured out and agreed on all the time. The Consecutive Transfer Extension Standard (EIP-2309) plans to make the creation of NFTs more efficient. Like rollups this reduces the amount of heavy lifting done on chain, allowing you to mint one billion NFTs in a single transaction.

[More on EIP-2309](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2309)

[to me this doesn't solve the problem if block space remains the same due to mining etc... should we include?]

<!-- Ethereum currently used proof-of-work to achieve consensus. It is a top priority of the community to transition to a proof-of-stake system, to increase decentralization, security and scalability, while reducing energy consumption requirements imposed from proof-of-work. Several layer 2 scaling solutions, such as rollups, are being developed and implemented which also aim to improve scalability while decreasing energy usage. EIP-2309 is a proposal also aiming to improve the efficiency of layer 1 NFT transactions.

Before these scaling solutions are fully implemented, it is worth noting that NFT's specifically are not necessarily _directly_ causing any increased carbon emission. The proof-of-work consensus mechanism that currently underlies the entire Ethereum blockchain is being used whether NFTs are being minted or not. If NFTs were to disappear today, there is a strong chance that block space would remain in demand for other reasons, though even if demand for block space decreased it wouldn't drastically impact energy consumption. For sake of example, imagine the demand for transacting on Ethereum falls to where the blocks are now empty. Miners would still be incentivized to produce blocks for the reward, and the hashing power required to do so would persist despite an empty block. More realistically, other transactions would take the place of NFT transactions. So again, there remains a strong and a active push to advance layer 2 solutions, and finalize Ethereum's transition to a proof-of-stake system.

All this being said, let's talk more about proof-of-work. Objectively there is a significant amount of energy that must be consumed in order to achieve the security that Ethereum offers.
Based on this, many people are quick to subjectively argue that the carbon footprint from proof-of-work blockchains is a "waste of energy."

Energy consumption is not fundamentally a "good" or "bad" thing, and very much depends on where the energy is coming from, and what it is being used for.
It is not up to any given individual to decide what is a "good" or "bad" use of energy for someone else. This same principle is used throughout Ethereum, where nobody can tell you that your transaction is not important.
For someone not using this technology, is it fair for them to dictate that this form of energy consumption is wasteful? What about those who's lives have been changed for the better as a result?

Externalities, such as carbon emissions based on choice of energy source, have not necessarily been priced in to the current system, but doing so would further encourage the use of renewable energy sources.
In this case, miners would migrate to lower cost alternatives. Since you can't transport energy effectively over great distances (energy lost in high voltage lines), this depreciates the capital cost of building renewable energy sources in more remote places. Someone looking to utilize renewable energy sources, such as solar farms, to run a mining rig could invest in a remote location where renewable energy sources are more accessible (ie: large open plots of land or at a waterfall). This energy would have otherwise been untapped, and "wasted" by not harnessing it. These investments in infrastructure open up the ability to serve a local community, and can be paid off much faster from the economic payoff received from mining.

The other side of the coin: Keep in mind that alternatives are not necessarily carbon-neutral either, such as the footprint of printing, handling, shipping and guarding fiat currencies. Annual spectacles of Christmas lights consume large amounts of energy, not to mention commercial products filling landfills, and governments engaging in war, leading to substantial levels of pollution.

Oh, and the same thing was said about the internet itself. Early measures of Google's search traffic led to incorrectly extrapolating that data to the future, forming incorrect conclusions about the unmanagable "waste of energy" that would follow. -->
