# Deprecated software {#summary-deprecated-software}

This is a list of key Ethereum-related projects and resources which have been deprecated or are no longer maintained. It is important to highlight deprecated work so that users can find viable alternatives and also to prevent malicious versions from being distributed.

## Software {#software}

This section is for software for the desktop, command line, or server which has been deprecated. The main types are wallets, integrated development environments, languages, and Ethereum clients. Definitely be careful to not install deprecated software unless you are certain it is from the original source, e.g. a repo hosted under https://github.com/ethereum.

### Grid {#grid}

Deprecated on December 10, 2020

**Summary**

Grid was a desktop application that allowed you to securely download, configure and use various clients and tools in the Ethereum ecosystem. Grid provided a user-friendly interface to assist a less technical audience in safely interacting with technical tools, which increased accessibility for everyone. 


**Archives**

[Archived GitHub repo](https://github.com/ethereum/grid)


**History**

Grid was a successor to Mist, removing the wallet but adding the ability to host nodes of multiple protocols.


**Alternatives**

[DappNode](https://dappnode.io/) is a platform for deploying and hosting DApps, P2P clients, and blockchain nodes.




### Meteor Dapp Wallet {#meteor-dapp-wallet}

Deprecated on March 27, 2019

**Summary**

This was an important component of Mist, an Ethereum wallet for managing keys, deploying and interacting with smart contracts. For many years the Meteor Dapp Wallet web UI was hosted as a subdomain on ethereum.org. 

The Mist Multisig Contract (solidity code) was also included, and Meteor Dapp Wallet featured a user interface for configuring and deploying it.

**Not deprecated: deployed Mist Multisigs**

The Mist Multisig -- deployed as bytecode to Ethereum mainnet by thousands of users -- continues to be used to store and manage value without incident. [How to Interact with a Mist Multisig Contract](https://support.mycrypto.com/how-to/sending/how-to-interact-with-a-multisig-contract) proves a good overview for how to use these smart contracts.

It also introduced users to innovations like blockies, cute and memorable 8-bit style graphics representing Ethereum keys.
