# Deprecated software {#summary-deprecated-software}

This is a list of key Ethereum-related projects and resources which have been deprecated or are no longer maintained. It is important to highlight deprecated work so that users can find viable alternatives and also to prevent malicious versions from being distributed.

## Software {#software}

This section is for software for the desktop, command line, or server which has been deprecated. The main types are wallets, integrated development environments, languages, and Ethereum clients. Definitely be careful to not install deprecated software unless you are certain it is from the original source, e.g. a repo hosted under https://github.com/ethereum.

### Grid {#grid}

Deprecated on December 10, 2020

Grid was a desktop application that allowed you to securely download, configure and use various clients and tools in the Ethereum ecosystem. Grid provided a user-friendly interface to assist a less technical audience in safely interacting with technical tools, which increased accessibility for everyone. 

Add in an alternative to grid? 

You can view the repository here:

### Meteor Dapp Wallet {#meteor-dapp-wallet}

Deprecated on March 27, 2019

This was an important component of Mist, and for many years the Meteor Dapp Wallet web UI was hosted as a subdomain on ethereum.org. The Mist multisig wallet solidity code was also included, deployable to EVM blockchains e.g. Ethereum mainnet via the UI. 

The wallet as bytecode deployed to EVM blockchains continues to be used to store value without incident. It can be interacted with directly, or via wallets like MyCrypto.

You can view the repository here:

- https://github.com/ethereum/meteor-dapp-wallet 

### Mist {#mist}

Deprecated on March 27, 2019

Mist was a concept browser that connected you to the ethereum blockchain and used p2p file transfer to access Dapps. 

You can view the repository here:

### Mix {#mix}

Mix was an IDE that allowed developers to build and deploy contracts and decentralized applications on top of the Ethereum blockchain.

You can view the repository here: 

- https://github.com/ethereum/mix 

We recommend using [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/#optimize=false&runs=200&evmVersion=null&version=soljson-v0.8.7+commit.e28d00a7.js) as an alternative web IDE for your Solidity development. 

### Parity {#parity}

### Trinity {#trinity}

## Communications {#communications}

### Gitter Channels {#gitter-channels}

## Dapps and Services {#dapps-and-services}

### Cover Protocol {#cover-protocol}

### The DAO {#the-dao}

This is a smart contract which was exploited, leading to a community-organized hard fork in order to return the funds to the stakeholders. The UX front-end is discontinued, and there is a smart contract for recovering funds.

### SparkPool {#sparkpool}

This was an Ethereum-centered mining pool based in the PRC. It was disbanded as a result of stricter legal regulations instituted in Fall 2021.
