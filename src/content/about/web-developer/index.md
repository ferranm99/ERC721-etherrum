## Your role {#your-role}

**Make ethereum.org (and the suite of Ethereum Foundation web applications) as performant, feature-rich and accessible as possible**. As a front-end developer, you'll create slick, fun and functional web applications visited by tens of millions of diverse Ethereum users each year. You'll collaborate with product, design and research teammates to shape the design and features of our products. You'll empower the next generation of Ethereum users and builders to change our world for the better.

## About you {#about-you}

- **You have an opinionated sense of design**. You're experienced collaborating with designers and user researchers but are comfortable building product interfaces yourself if needed.
- **You have an ownership mentality**. When you take on a task, you get it done. You proactively troubleshoot problems blocking your path, and the problems blocking the paths of others.
- **You enjoy teaching as much as you enjoy learning**. You’re comfortable writing technical content for developers including documentation, project templates and tutorials.
- **You're comfortable pitching in to get the job done**. We're a small team, sometimes you may have to do work outside of your "core responsibilities".
- **You're fascinated by Ethereum**... the community as much as the technology.
