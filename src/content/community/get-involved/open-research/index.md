# Ethereum open areas of research

Do you have a background in mathematics, cryptography, or economics? You might be interested in some of the cutting-edge work being done within the Ethereum ecosystem.

**TODOs**

- [x] Create basic page
- [ ] Talk to researchers - what are the open questions? What are topics & resources?
- [ ] Decide how topics should be categorized - what's the hierarchy?
## Page Content Structure
- There should be as few categories as possible needed to achieve the following:
    - encompass the full gamut of research topics
    - differentiated enough from each other to minimise sub-category redundancy and duplication
        - sub-categories may qualify in multiple Parent Categories, but this should be minimised to reduce confusion
- Ideally, less than [10 main categories, with less than 12 sub-categories within each](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303676802_HICK%27S_LAW_IS_MIRRORED_IN_THE_BRAIN_AN_FMRI_STUDY_OF_THE_CHOICE_REACTION_TIME).
    - This is to reduce the cognitive load of parsing too many categories if they are all displayed at once
    - There should be an AJAX style search bar that allows users to search categories, with some intelligent matching of synonyms
    - The Parent Categories should be sufficiently broad, yet clearly delineated so the location of Sub-Categories are obvious to the average user familiar with the Topic.
- Researchers should weigh in on whether the categories are redundant/incomplete/contradictory.
- Sub-Categories as tags, not folders.
    - In some cases, sub-categories may appear across multiple main categories based on application
        - eg: Zero Knowledge Proofs can appear in Privacy, Security AND Scalability, depending on the context ZKPs are being used or applied.
        - Or should ZKPs be their own Parent Category?
        - These are the kinds of discussions/arguments we need to have around the organisational hierarchy of the information

## Sample: ESP’s [Parent Categories](https://esp.ethereum.foundation/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fabout.9c9105a9.png&w=828&q=75)

> ESP's categories are very clear and have good delineation, many topics would fall very clearly into one Category exclusively. One area to improve would be to make “Research” less broad, and to specify more discrete Topics which require Research.

- Community & Education
- Consensus Layer
- Cryptography & zkp
- Execution Layer
- Layer 2
- Libraries & Tooling
- Research

## Metadata displayed under Content/Research Topic

- Title (Header would be the name of the area of research)
    - Outline (Brief writeup of the Scope or Research Topic within larger Area of Research) [sample](https://blog.ethereum.org/2022/02/24/japan-local-grants-round/)
        - List of Teams/Researchers/People working on Research Topic
- Additional Information (optional/good to have)
    - Existing funding and grants

### Open Source Submission Inputs

- Allow user submission of Areas of Research
- Allow user submission of Teams/Researchers/People under Area of Research
## Community

List general communities / resources for general topics?

- [Ethresear.ch](https://ethresear.ch) - Ethereum’s primary forum for research

List different categories of research...

## Protocol

Is this a valid category? What best captures these topics?
e.g. various upgrades https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/

### Consensus

Should this just be "proof-of-stake" at this point? Or other relevant areas of consensus research?

Separate consensus layer & execution layer as top-level categories?

### Hash Functions

Include miscellaneous places to find areas of opportunity/investment?

- [Challenges.ethereum.org](https://challenges.ethereum.org/) - a series of high-value research bounties, where you can earn >$100,000 USD

- [Ecosystem Support Program's wishlist](https://esp.ethereum.foundation/wishlist/) - research areas where the Ethereum Ecosystem Support Program is actively seeking grant applications
