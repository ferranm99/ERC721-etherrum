# Ethereum open areas of research

Do you have a background in mathematics, cryptography, or economics? You might be interested in some of the cutting-edge work being done within the Ethereum ecosystem.

**TODOs**

- [x] Create basic page
- [ ] Talk to researchers - what are the open questions? What are topics & resources?
- [ ] Decide how topics should be categorized - what's the hierarchy?

## Community

List general communities / resources for general topics?

- [Ethresear.ch](https://ethresear.ch) - Ethereumâ€™s primary forum for research

List different categories of research...

## Protocol

Is this a valid category? What best captures these topics?
e.g. various upgrades https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/

### Consensus

Should this just be "proof-of-stake" at this point? Or other relevant areas of consensus research?

Separate consensus layer & execution layer as top-level categories?

Include miscellaneous places to find areas of opportunity/investment?

- [Challenges.ethereum.org](https://challenges.ethereum.org/) - a series of high-value research bounties, where you can earn >$100,000 USD

- [Ecosystem Support Program's wishlist](https://esp.ethereum.foundation/wishlist/) - research areas where the Ethereum Ecosystem Support Program is actively seeking grant applications
