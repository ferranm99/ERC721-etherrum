_Defi is an alternative to a financial system that many of us have grown to mistrust thanks to the cycles of mismanagement, crashes, and bail outs. It's an open global system that gives you more control and visibility over your money. It's exposure to global markets when your currency at home is failing. And there are no banker bonuses – it's largely owned by its users or maintained as a public good. And right now there's over 40 billion dollars worth of crypto in defi applications._

## What's defi?

Defi is a collective term for products that are making financial products and services accessible to anyone who can use Ethereum – anyone with an internet connection. With defi, there are no centralized authorities who can block payments or deny you access to anything.

There's a booming crypto economy out there, where you can lend, borrow, long/short, earn interest, and more. Crypto-savvy Argentinians have used defi to escape crippling inflation. Companies have started streaming their employees their wages in real time. Some folks have even taken out and paid off loans worth millions of dollars without the need for any personal identification.

## Defi vs traditional finance

One of the best ways to see the potential of defi is to understand the problems that exist today.

- Some people aren't granted access to set up a bank account or use financial services
- Financial services can block you from getting paid
- The hidden charge of financial services is your personal data
- Governments can close down markets at will
- Money transfers can take days due to internal human processes
- There's a premium to financial services because intermediray institutions need their cut

## What can you do with defi?

There's a decentralized alternative to most financial services. But Ethereum also creates opportunities for creating financial products that are completely new. This is an ever-growing list.

- [Send money around the globe](#send-money)
- [Stream money around the globe](#stream-money)
- [Access stable currencies](#stablecoins)
- [Lend/borrow funds](#lending)
- [Borrow without collateral](#flash-loans)
- [Start crypto savings](#savings)
- [Swap tokens](#swaps)
- [Trade??](#trading)
- [Grow your portfolio](#investing)
- [Fund your ideas](#crowdfunding)

### Send money around the globe quickly {#send-money}

As a blockchain, Ethereum is designed for sending transactions in a secure and global way. Payments go directly from one account to another in a matter of minutes (usually). To send/receive payments you'll need a wallet.

<DocLink to="/wallets/" title="More on wallets" />

#### Stream money around the globe... {#stream-money}

It's also possible to stream money over Ethereum. This would let you pay someone their salary by the second, giving them access to their money whenever they need it.

### Access to stable currencies {#stablecoins}

Although a lot of cryptocurrencies are known for their volatility, the defi community has invested a lot of time in creating stability out of volatility with stablecoins. Their value stays pegged to an another asset, usually a popular currency like dollars.

Coins like Dai or USDC have a value that stays within a few cents of a dollar. This makes them perfect for earning or retail. So far many people in Latin America have used stablecoins as a way of protecting their savings in a time of great uncertainty with their government-issued currencies.

### Lending and borrowing {#lending}

Today, lending and borrowing money all revolves around the individuals involved. Banks need to know whether you're likely to repay a loan before lending. Some see this as an invasion of privacy.

Decentralized lending works without either party having to identify themselves. Instead the borrower must put up collateral that the lender will automatically receive if their loan is not repaid.

Loans can be peer-to-peer, meaning a borrower will borrow directly from a specific lender. Or they can be pool-based where lenders provide liquidity to a pool that borrowers can borrow from.

Some lenders even accept NFTs as collateral. NFTs are a deed to a unique asset, like a painting. [More on NFTs](/nfts/)

A more experimental form of decentralized lending lets you borrow without collateral or providing any personal information...

#### Flash loans {#flash-loans}

Flash loans are not advised if you're not a technical expert but they hint at what might be possible to everyone in the future. With Ethereum you can take out huge loans without putting up any collateral whatsoever.

It works on the premise that the loan is taken out and paid back within the same transaction. If it can't be paid back, the transaction reverts as if nothing ever happened.

This means a lot of logic must be included in a very bespoke transaction. A simple example might be someone using a flash loan to borrow as much of an asset at one price so they can sell it on a different exchange where the price is higher.

So in a single transaction the following happens:

- You borrow X amount of $asset at $1.00 from exchange A
- You sell X $asset on exchange B for $1.10
- You pay back loan to exchange A
- You keep the profit minus the transaction fee

If exchange B's supply dropped suddenly and the user wasn't able to buy enoughh to cover the original loan, the transaction would simply fail.

### Start saving with crypto {#saving}

You can earn interest on your crypto by lending it. For example, you can lend your Dai to a product like Aave and receive Aave Dai (aDai) which is a token that represents your loaned Dai. Your aDai will increase based on the interest rates and you can see it grow in real-time in your wallet. Your aDai also lets you withdraw the equivalent in Dai at any time.

Etheruem has also seen a new way to save emerge: no-loss lotteries.

No-loss lotteries like PoolTogether are a fun and innovative new way to save money. Buy tickets for a lottery that you can't lose. Only one winner is chosen every week, but your tickets roll over and you can withdraw at any time. The prize pot is generated by the interest gained on all the tickets.

### Swapping tokens {#swaps}

There are lots of tokens on Ethereum. Decentralized exchanges let you trade your tokens while always having control of your assets.

When you use a centralized exchange you have to deposit your assets before the trade and trust them to look after them. While your assets are deposited, they're at risk as centralized exchanges are attractive targets for hackers.

### Trading and prediction markets {#trading}

??? [ Not sure what to write here ]

### Grow your portfolio {#investing}

There are fund management products on Ethereum that will try to grow your portfolio based on a strategy of your choice. This is automatic and doesn't need a human manager taking a cut of your profits.

TokenSets, a popular investment product, tokenises investment strategies and calls them sets. A set represents a portfolio with a strategy. For example, their "ETH 26 Day EMA Crossover" set will aim to accumulate as much ETH as possible by rebalancing the portfolio between ETH and USDC. You don't have to manually handle any portfolio rebalancing. As long as you have the Set token in your wallet, you can withraw the portfolio as individual tokens whenever you like.

### Fund your ideas {#crowdfunding}

Ethereum is open source software. A lot of the work so far has been funded by the community and this has led to the growth of an interesting new fundraising model: quadratic funding. This method has the potential to improve the way we fund all types of public goods in the future.

Quadratic funding makes sure that the projects that receive the most funding are those with the most unique demand. In other words, projects that stand to improve the lives of the most people. Here's how it works:

1. There is a matching pool of funds donated.
2. A round of public funding starts.
3. People can signal their demand for a project by donating some money.
4. Once the round is over, the matching pool is distributed to projects. Those with the most unique demand get the highest amount from the matching pool.

This means project A that received 100 donations of 1 dollar could end up with more funding than project B which received a single donation of 10,000 dollars (dependent on the size of the matching pool).

## How does defi work?

Defi uses cryptocurrencies and smart contracts to provide services that don't need intermediaries. In today's financial world, financial institutions acts as guarantors of transactions. This gives these institutions immense power – even the power to stop you making transactions because your money flows through them. And discrimination is rife – billions of people around the world don't have access to a bank account.

In defi, a smart contract replaces the financial institution in the transaction. A smart contract is a type of Ethereum account that can hold funds and can send/refund them based on certain conditions. No one can alter that smart contract when it's live. So it will always run exactly as programmed.

A pocket money contract that's programmed to send money from Account A to Account B every Friday will only ever do that. So long as Account A has the required funds. No one can change the contract and add Account C as a recipient to steal funds.

## Ethereum and defi

Ethereum is the perfect foundation for defi for a number of reasons:

- No one owns Ethereum or the smart contracts that live on it – this gives everyone an opportunity to use defi.
- Defi products all speak the same language behind the scenes: Ethereum. This means many of the products can be used in tandem. You can lend tokens on one platform, and exchange the interest-bearing token in a different market on an entirely different application. This is like being able to cash your Starbucks loyalty points in at your bank.
- Tokens and cryptocurrency are built into Ethereum, a shared ledger – keeping track of transactions and ownership is kinda Ethereum's thing.
- Ethereum allows complete financial freedom – none of these products ever take custody of your funds. You are always in control.

You can think of defi in layers:

1. The blockchain – Ethereum contains the transaction history and state of accounts.
2. The assets – ETH and the other tokens (currencies).
3. The protocols – a smart contract that provideds the functionality, for example the service that allows for decentralized lending of the assets.
4. The applications – the products we use to manage and access the protocols.

### Want to build defi?

Defi is an open-source movement. The defi protocols and applications are all open for you to inspect, fork, and innovate on. Because of this layered stack (they all share the same base blockchain and assets), protocols can be mixed and matched to unlock unique combo opportunities.

<!-- TODO: Write a build defi dapp intro page in developers section -->

<!-- ## Opportunities and risks

At such an early stage in defi, there are both opportunities and risks. Make sure you're aware of both before diving in.

### Opportunities

- **Combination opportunities** – the system is open, new products are coming to market all the time that combine existing services to unlock new opportunities.
- **Greater efficiency** – smart contracts remove the need for custodians and escrows reducing transaction time and cost without compromising security.
- **More transparency** – everything is public, this makes auditing and understanding risks a lot easier. If something does go wrong, investigations are far simpler.
- **More accessible** – defi allows you to use these markets without giving away your identity. These protocols are open to everyone an can't discriminate based on personal details.

### Risks

- **Smart contracts**
  - they are the backbone of defi so if there a smart contract bug it poses a big risk to the protocol's users.
  - At this early stage, you are at a disadvantage if you can't read the code and verify its safety yourself. Instead you must trust the protocol and any third party security audits.
  - one smart contract bug can have a devastating effect within the ecosystem if other products rely on that smart contract. This is one of the downsides of Ethereum's combination oppportunities.
- **Admin keys**
  - oten teams will set up their smart contracts with admin keys. These keys allow them to upgrade the contract and shut it down in an emergency. If a malicious actor got these keys they could potentially drain funds from the contract.
- **External data**
  - a lot of defi relies on external data sources, provided by oracles. If an oracle's data is compromised...
- **Scalability**
  - demand raises tx fees which price some people out of defi
-

- a single smart contract bug can have a devastating effect within the ecosystem because it's so composable
- external data: oracles introduce centralization
- fiat on/off-ramps: for the most part, getting funds out of defi into the traditional financial system requires KYC and regulation
- scalability: rises in transaction fees favour wealthy participants and price some people out of the ecosystem
  - layer 2 solutions put atomicity and composability at risk -->

<!-- ## How to defi

Before you try out any defi products, remember that we are in the early stages of this financial revolution. Only spend what you can afford and do your research.

### Transaction fees

Defi relies on Ethereum to keep transactions secure. Ethereum security comes at a cost. The people who do the work to make Ethereum safe, known as miners, must be incentivised. Transaction fees are part of the incentive for securing Ethereum – think of it like a tip to the person processing your transaction. However, this fee is variable and increases when the network is busy. After all, miners need to prioritise all the pending transactions and they're incentivised to choose transactions which include a larger tip. This is known in the community as "gas" as it "fuels" the transaction.

<InfoBanner isWarning emoji=":fuel_pump:">
    Using defi products right now is expensive. The network is in such high demand that gas is very expensive. The community is working on ways to improve the network's capacity, but don't be surprised if you see gas prices exceed your transaction value.

</InfoBanner>

### On/off-ramps

Getting funds in or out of defi into the traditional financial system will require a ramp.

### The defi essentials

- a wallet – you'll need one to connect to applications and manage your funds.
- some Eth – you'll need to pay transaction fees
- some time – don't defi in a rush, take time to read everything, double check everything. With greater financial freedom comes some risk. In most cases sending funds to the wrong place is irreversible.

### Do a token swap

todo – is it worth it with current gas prices?

### Earn some interest
