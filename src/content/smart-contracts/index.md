## What's a smart contract? {#smart-contract-definition}

A smart contract is a computer program. Specifically, it's a program that runs on decentralized networks/computers. 

This article should take you on the following mini-journey:

- So what is a smart contract?
- Ahh ok... why would we want to have smart contracts?
- I kind of get it... can you provide me some examples?

So, what is a smart contract? Is this just a clever brand name? Believe it or not, it's an unadulterated tech/cypherpunk term.

Nick Szabo (a computer scientist, mathematician and crypto icon) coined the term "smart contract". In 1994, he wrote [an introduction to the concept](https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/smart.contracts.html) and, in 1996, [an exploration of what smart contracts could do](https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/smart_contracts_2.html).

Nick Szabo envisioned a digital marketplace built on these automatic, cryptographically secure processes. A place where transactions and business functions can happen trustlessly — without intermediaries. Ethereum is putting that vision into practice.

## (Dumb) contracts vs. smart contracts {#smart-contract-term}

Why is a smart contract called a contract? Why do we need contracts to be smart? To answer that, let's look at what a traditional pen-and-paper contract really does.

For example, let's consider a classic pork bellies futures contract. The buyer agrees to pay the current market price for a certain amount of pork at some point in the future. The seller agrees to sell at that price, deliver that quantity and meet that deadline.

You have three variables: price, quantity and date. Pretty simple, right?

Here's another example. You sign a sales contract for a used car, which allows the dealership to take your money and give you the car.

What do these contracts do? Essentially, they represent agreements. They provide an outline for a transaction.

## If normal contracts work, why do we need smart contracts? {#why-smart-contracts}

The ink-and-paper method is fine for some things, but it isn't the be-all and end-all. Basically, we need smart contracts because regular contracts can't do enough.

### Automation {#automation}

One main advantage of smart contracts is that they can act automatically. For example, you could write a smart contract that holds funds in escrow for your future pork belly purchase, transferring the money to the seller once you both confirm receipt. You could write a contract that automatically gives you a digital version of a car's title when you pay the dealer.

Automation eliminates the need to trust an intermediary in many cases. It also simplifies transactions.

### Public record {#public-record}

Smart contracts would also be useful for audits and tracking. Since Ethereum smart contracts are on a public blockchain, anyone can instantly track asset transfers and various other information. You can check to see that someone sent money to your address, for example.

### Privacy protection {#privacy-protection

Smart contracts can also protect our privacy. Since Ethereum is a pseudonymous network (your transactions are tied publicly to a unique cryptographic address, not your personal identity), you can protect your privacy from observers.

### Visible terms and predictable outcomes {#predictable-outcomes}

Finally, like contracts, you can check what's in a smart contract before you sign it (or otherwise interact with it). Better yet, you can predict exactly how these computer programs will act — something that is certainly not always true with the intermediary parties that handle ink-and-paper contracts.

## Smart contracts: use cases {#use-cases}

So, smart contracts are computer programs that live on the blockchain. They can execute automatically. You can track their transactions, predict how they act and even use them pseudonymously. That's cool. But...

But what are they good for? Well, smart contracts can do anything that other complete-computer programs do. 

They can perform computations, create currency, record data, mint NFTs, send communications and even generate graphics. Here are some popular, real-world examples:

- An automatic, open currency exchange
- A cat-collecting and -breeding game
- A US Dollar coin factory
- A standard that lets people create customized, interoperable currencies
