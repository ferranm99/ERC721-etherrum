## What is solo staking? {#what-is-solo-staking}

Solo staking is the act of running an Ethereum node connected to the internet and depositing 32Â ETH to activate a [validator](#what-is-a-validator), giving you the ability to participate directly in network consensus.

Running an Ethereum node consists of running both an execution layer (EL) client, as well as a consensus layer (CL) client. These clients are software that work together, along with a valid set of signing keys, to verify transactions and blocks, attest to the correct head of the chain, aggregate attestations, and propose blocks.

Solo stakers are responsible for operating the hardware needed to run these clients. It is highly recommended to use a dedicated machine for this that you operate from home â€“ this is extremely beneficial to the health of the network.

A solo staker receives rewards directly from the protocol for simply being online and properly fulfilling tasks assigned to it when needed. Note, the user just needs to keep the node powered and online with clients running; the client software will do the rest.

Being offline results in small penalties roughly in the amount of what you would have earned in that same amount of time. Slashing is a more serious penalty reserved for malicious behavior, which results in losing at least 0.5Â ETH and ejection from the network.

## Why stake solo? {#why-stake-solo}

Solo staking provides you with maximum power as well as maximum responsibility. Here's a few things to consider when deciding if you'd like to solo stake vs. using a staking service or joining a staking pool.

<Card title="Full control">
  Solo staking allows you to completely customize your staking setup. You can configure your hardware, your software clients, your monitoring setup, choose which upgrades you support, etc. Unlike pool services that often make this decisions for you.
</Card>
<Card title="Network security">
  Solo staking is the most impactful way to stake. By running a validator on your own hardware, you help ensure the Ethereum protocol remains robust, decentralized, and secure.
</Card>
<Card title="Maximum rewards">
  You'll earn full rewards from the Ethereum protocol when you solo stake, unlike staking pools or staking services that all extract a fee..
</Card>

## Considerations before staking solo {#considerations-before-staking-solo}

As much as we wish that solo staking was accessible and risk free to everyone, this is not reality. There are some practical and serious considerations to keep in mind before choosing to solo stake your ETH.

<Card title="Required reading">
  When operating your own node you should spend some time learning how to use the software you've chosen. This should involve reading relevant documentation and being attune to communication channels of those dev teams.
  The more you understand about the software you're running and how proof-of-stake works, the less risky it will be as a staker, and the easier it will be to fix any issues that may arise along the way as a node operator. 
</Card>
<Card title="Comfortable with computers">
  Node setup requires a reasonable comfort level when working with computers, although new tools are making this easier over time. Understanding of the command-line interface is helpful, but no longer strictly required 
  It also requires very basic hardware setup, and some understanding of minimum recommended specs.
</Card>
<Card title="Secure key management">
  Just like how private keys secure your Ethereum address, you will need to generate keys specifically for your validator. You must understand how to keep any seed phrases or private keys safe and secure.

</Card>
<Card title="No withdrawing (for now)">
Withdrawing staked ETH or rewards from a validator balance is not yet supported. Support for withdrawals are planned for the Shanghai upgrade following The Merge. You should anticipate your ETH being locked for at least one-to-two years. After Shanghai, this will no longer be the case, at which point you will be able to freely withdraw portions or all of your stake if you wish.
</Card>
<Card title="Maintenance">
Hardware occasionally fails, connections error out, and client software occasionally needs upgrading. Node maintenance is inevitable and will occasionally require your attention. You'll want to be sure you stay aware of any anticipated network upgrades, or other critical client upgrades.
</Card>
<Card title="Reliable Uptime">
Your rewards are proportional to the time your validator is online and properly attesting. Downtime incurs penalties roughly equal to what you would have earned in that same amount of time. Being offline while the network is finalizing does not result in slashing.
Epoch rewards are inversely proportional to how long it takes your attestations to be included, meaning internet bandwidth also matter. This can vary, but a minimum of 10Â Mb/s up and down is recommended.
</Card>

## How does it compare?

**Staking as a service (SaaS)** - With SaaS providers you're still required to deposit 32Â ETH, but don't have to run hardware. You typically maintain access to your validator keys, but also need to share your signing keys so the operator can act on behalf of your validator. This introduces a layer of trust not present when running your own hardware, and unlike solo staking at home, SaaS does not help as much with geographic distribution of nodes. If you're uncomfortable operating hardware but still looking to stake 32Â ETH, [learn more about staking as a service](/staking/as-a-service).

**Pooled staking** -
Solo staking is significantly more involved than staking with a pooling service, but offer full access to ETH rewards, and full control over the setup and security of your validator. Pooled staking has a significantly lower barrier to entry. Users can stake small amounts of ETH, are not required to generate validator keys, and have no hardware requirements beyond a standard internet connection. Liquidity tokens enable the ability to exit from staking before this is enabled at the protocol level. If you're interested, [learn more about pooled staking](/staking/pools).

## How it works

1. Get some hardware: You need to run a node to stake. [Learn more](/run-a-node)
2. Sync an execution layer (EL) client
3. Sync a consensus layer (CL) client
4. Generate your keys: Load them into your validator client
5. Monitor and maintain your node

If ever desired, you can exit as a validator which eliminates the requirement to be online, and stops any further rewards. Be aware that until the planned Shanghai upgrade _withdrawing_ those funds will not be possible.

After Shanghai, users will be able to withdraw their rewards as well as their stake if they choose.

## Get started on the Staking Launchpad

The Staking Launchpad is an open source application that will help you become a validator. It walks you through a preparation checklist, how to choose clients, generate your keys and assists with depositing your ETH to the staking deposit contract.

<!-- <LaunchpadWidget> -->

Choose network
<select>

<option value="prater">Goerli/Prater Testnets</option>
<option value="mainnet">Mainnet</option>
</select>

ðŸ§ª Solo validators are expected to **test their setup** and operational skills on the prater testnet before risking funds. Remember it is important to choose a [minority client](/client-diversity) as it improves the security of the network, and limits your risk.

<code>If you're comfortable with it, you can set up everything needed from the command line using the Staking Launchpad alone.</code>

ðŸ›  To make things easier, check out some of the tools and guides below that can help you alongside the Staking Launchpad to get your clients set up with ease.

- **What is a validator?**

A _validator_ is a virtual entity that lives on the Beacon Chain, represented by a balance, public key, and other properties. A _validator client_ is the software that acts on behalf of the validator by holding and using its private key. A single validator client can hold many key pairs, controlling many validators.

Each key-pair associated with a validator requires 32Â ETH to be activated. More ETH deposited to a single set of keys does not increase rewards potential, as each validator is limited to an [effective balance]() of 32Â ETH. This means that staking is done in 32Â ETH increments, each with it's own set of keys and balance.

Do not deposit more than 32Â ETH for a single validator. It will be locked until the planned Shanghai update.

If solo staking seems too demanding you you, consider using a [staking-as-a-service](/staking/saas) provider, or if you're working with less than 32Â ETH, check out the [staking pools](/staking/pools).
