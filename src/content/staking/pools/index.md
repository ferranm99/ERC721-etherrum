## What are staking pools? {#what-are-staking-pools}

Staking pools are a collaborative approach to allow many with smaller amounts of ETH to obtain the 32 ETH required to activate a set of validator keys. Pooling functionality is not natively supported within the protocol, so solutions were built out separately to address this need.

Some pools operate using smart contracts, where funds can be deposited to a contract, which trustlessly manages and tracks your stake, and issues you a token that represents this value. Other pools may not involve smart contracts and are instead mediated off-chain.

## Why stake with a pool? {#why-stake-with-a-pool}

In addition to the benefits we outlined in our [intro to staking](/staking), staking with a pool comes with a number of distinct benefits.

    Not a whale? No problem. Most staking pool lets you stake virtually any amount of ETH by joining forces with other stakers, unlike staking solo which requires 32 ETH.

    Staking with a pool is as easy as a token swap. No need to worry about hardware setup and node maintenance. Pools allow you to deposit your ETH which enables node operators to run validators. Rewards are then distributed to contributors minus a fee for node operations.

  <Card title="Liquidity tokens" emoji=":droplet:">
    Many staking pools provide a token that represents a claim on your staked ETH and the rewards it generates. This allows you to make use of your staked ETH, e.g. as collateral in DeFi applications.

## What to consider {#what-to-consider}

Pooled or delegated staking is not natively supported by the Ethereum protocol, but given the demand for users to stake less than 32 ETH a growing number of solutions have been built out to serve this demand.

Each pool and the tools or smart contracts they use have been built out by different teams and each come with their own risks and benefits.

Attribute indicators are used below to signal notable strengths or weaknesses a listed staking pool may have. Use this section as a reference for how we define these attributes while you're choosing a pool to join.

<Emoji text="⚠️" mr="1rem" /> Please note the importance of choosing a service that takes <a href="/client-diversity">client diversity</a> seriously, as it improves the security of the network, and limits your risk. Services that have evidence of limiting majority client use are marked as "diverse clients."
