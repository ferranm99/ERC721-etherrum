#### How to stake your ETH

# Stake your ETH to earn rewards while securing Ethereum

Staking is a public good for the Ethereum ecosystem. **Any user with any amount of ETH can help** secure the network and earn rewards in the process.

## Why stake ETH?

Staking is the act of locking up ETH to give you the right to participate in block proposals on the network. Anyone who holds even a small amount of ETH can consider staking.

<Card title="More sustainable">
  Stakers don’t need energy-intensive computers in order to participate in a proof-of-stake system – just a laptop or smartphone. This will make Ethereum better for the environment.
</Card>
<Card title="Better security">
  The network gets stronger against attacks as more ETH is staked, as it then requires more ETH to control a majority of the network. To become a threat, you would need to hold the majority of validators, which means you'd need to control the majority of ETH in the system – that's a lot!
</Card>
<Card title="Earn rewards">
  Rewards are given for actions that help the network reach consensus. You'll get rewards for batching transactions into a new block or checking the work of other validators because that's what keeps the chain running securely.

## How to stake ETH?

It all depends on how much you are willing to stake. You'll need 32 ETH to activate your own validator, but it is possible to stake less.

Check out the options below and go for the one that is best for you, and for the network.

## Solo home staking

> **Most impactful**, full control, keep all the rewards, trustless

Solo staking on the Ethereum Beacon Chain is the <gold>gold standard</gold> for staking. It is trustless, provides full participation rewards, and improves the decentralization of the network.

Those considering solo staking should have at least 32 ETH, hardware connected to the internet ~24/7, and some technical know-how.

Over time, tooling has improved to help users get past some of the technical hurdles, including options to bypass the command-line altogether, if that’s not your thing.

Check out some solo staking tools, then get started staking on the Prater Testnet over on the [Launchpad](https://prater.launchpad.ethereum.org).

## Staking as a service

> Your 32 ETH, your validator keys, entrusted node operation

Running your own hardware is always recommended if possible for the strength and health of the network, but we recognize this isn’t always reasonable for all users.

If you don’t want or feel comfortable dealing with hardware, but still want to stake your 32 ETH, staking-as-a-service options allow you to delegate the hard part, while you earn native block rewards.

These options usually walk you through creating a set of validator credentials, uploading your signing keys to them, and depositing your 32 ETH. This allows the service to validate on your behalf.

This method of staking requires a certain level of trust in the provider. To limit counter-party risk, the keys to withdrawal your ETH are usually kept in your possession.

## Pooled staking

> Stake what you can, earn rewards, keep it simple (Popular)

Several pooling solutions now exist to assist users who do not have or feel comfortable staking 32 ETH.

Many of these options include what is known as “liquid staking” which involves an ERC-20 liquidity token that represents your staked ETH.

This can enable easy and any-time exiting, and makes staking as simple as a token swap. These options also allow/require users to hold custody of their assets in their own Ethereum wallet.

Pooled staking is not native to the Ethereum network, and thus have been built out by third parties, and carry their own risk.

## Centralized exchanges & staking providers

> **Least impactful**, highest trust assumptions

Ethereum users are encourgaged to stake by the best means possible for the health and decentralization of the network, which tends to involve individuals taking control instead of centralized agencies.

If you are not yet comfortable holding ETH in your own wallet, options such as centralized exchanges and other custodial providers provide staking-as-a-service and can be a fallback to allow you to earn some yield on your ETH holdings, with minimal oversight or effort.

The trade-off here is that centralized providers consolidate large pools of ETH to run large numbers of validators. This can be dangerous for the network as it creates a large centralized target and point of failure, making the network more vulnerable to attack or bugs.

Users should stake by the best means possible, _within their means_. If you don’t feel comfortable holding your own keys, that’s okay. These options are here for you.

In the meantime, consider checking out our [wallets page](/wallets/), where you can get started learning how to take true ownership over your funds. When you’re ready, come back and level up your staking game by trying one of the self-custody pooled staking services offered.

> Given the number of these unique solutions, they vary in terms of risks, rewards, and trust assumptions. Some of them are more decentralized, battle-tested and/or risky than others. We’ll provide some information on popular projects in the space, but **always do your own research** before sending ETH anywhere.

## Comparison of staking options

There is no one-size-fits-all solution for staking, and each is unique. Here we'll compare some of the risks, rewards and requirements of the different ways you can stake.

### Solo staking

#### Rewards

- Receive rewards directly from the protocol for actions that help the network reach consensus.
- You’ll get rewards for batching transactions into a new block or checking the work of other validators to keep the chain running securely.

#### Risks

- Your ETH is at stake.
- There are penalties, which cost ETH, for going offline.
- Malicious behavior can result in “slashing” of larger amounts of ETH and forced ejection from the network.

#### Requirements

- You must deposit 32 ETH.
- Maintain hardware that runs both an Ethereum execution client and consensus client while connected to the internet.
- The [Staking Launchpad](https://prater.launchpad.ethereum.org/) will walk you through the process and hardware requirements.

### Staking as a service

> Services will vary

#### Rewards

- Usually involved full protocol rewards minus monthly fee for node operations.
- Dashboards often available to easily track your validator client.

#### Risks

- Subject to same risks as solo staking plus counter-party risk of service provider.
- Your ETH is at stake, and safe use of your signing keys is entrusted to someone else who could behave maliciously.

#### Requirements

- Deposit 32 ETH and generate your keys with assistance.
- The rest is taken care of, though specific services will vary.

### Pooled staking

#### Rewards

- Pooled stakers accrue rewards differently, depending on which method of pooled staking chosen.
- Many pooled staking services offer one or more liquidity tokens that represents your staked ETH plus your share of the validator rewards.
- Liquidity tokens can be held in your own wallet, used in defi and sold if you decide to exit.

#### Risks

- The risks to pooled staking vary depending on the method used.
- In general risks consist of a combination of counter-party, smart contract and execution risk.

#### Requirements

- To join a pool, you will need to have some ETH in your own wallet.
- From there you can deposit directly to different pooled staking platforms, or you can simply trade for one of the staking liquidity tokens.
