              ETH is a cryptocurrency. It is scarce digital money that you can
              use on the internet – similar to Bitcoin. If you’re new to crypto,
              here's how ETH is different from traditional money.

          <p>
            There are many cryptocurrencies and lots of other tokens on
            Ethereum, but there are some things that only ETH can do.

            <h4>ETH fuels and secures Ethereum</h4>
            <p>
              ETH is the lifeblood of Ethereum. When you send ETH or use an
              Ethereum application, you'll pay a small fee in ETH to use the
              Ethereum network. This fee is an incentive for a miner to process
              and verify what you're trying to do.
            </p>
            <p>
              Miners are like the record-keepers of Ethereum – they check and
              prove that no one is cheating. Miners who do this work are also
              rewarded with small amounts of newly-issued ETH.
            </p>
            <p>
              The work miners do keeps Ethereum secure and free of centralized
              control. In other words, <strong>ETH powers Ethereum</strong>.

            <h4>ETH underpins the Ethereum financial system</h4>
            <p>
              Not satisfied with payments, the Ethereum community is building a
              whole financial system that's peer-to-peer and accessible to
              everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can use ETH as collateral to generate entirely different
              cryptocurrency tokens on Ethereum. Plus you can borrow, lend and
              earn interest on ETH and other ETH-backed tokens.

            <p>
              Because Ethereum is programmable, developers can shape ETH in
              countless ways.

          <h3>Why does ETH have value?</h3>
          <p>ETH's valuable in different ways to different people.</p>
          <p>
            For users of Ethereum, ETH is valuable because it lets you pay
            transaction fees.
          </p>
          <p>
            Others see it as a digital store of value because the creation of
            new ETH slows down over time.
          </p>
          <p>
            More recently, ETH has become valuable to users of financial apps on
            Ethereum. That's because you can use ETH as collateral for crypto
            loans, or as a payment system.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course many also see it as an investment, similar to Bitcoin or
            other cryptocurrencies.

          <h3>ETH isn't the only crypto on Ethereum</h3>
          <p>
            Anyone can create new kinds of assets and trade them on Ethereum.
            These are known as "tokens". People have tokenised traditional
            currencies, their real estate, their art, and even themselves!{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            Ethereum is home to thousands of tokens – some more useful and
            valuable than others. Developers are constantly building new tokens
            that unlock new possibilities and open new markets.
