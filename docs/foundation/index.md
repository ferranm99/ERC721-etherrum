# About the Ethereum Foundation

</div>

The [Ethereum Foundation](http://ethereum.foundation/) (EF) is a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting [Ethereum](/what-is-ethereum/) and related technologies.

The EF is not a company, or even a traditional non-profit. Their role is not to control or lead Ethereum, nor are they the only organization that funds critical development of Ethereum-related technologies. The EF is one part of a much larger [ecosystem](/community/).


## Ethereum Foundation Initiatives

### Ecosystem Support Program

The [Ecosystem Support Program](https://ecosystem.support/) exists to provide both financial and non-financial support to projects and entities within the greater Ethereum community, in order to accelerate the growth of the ecosystem. The Ecosystem Support Program is an expansion of the original Ethereum Grants Program which mainly focused on financial support.

Learn more about the Ecosystem Support Program, past grant recipients, and the grant application process at [ecosystem.support](https://ecosystem.support/). You can also view the [Ecosystem Support Program Blog](https://blog.ethereum.org/category/ecosystem-support-program/) for their latest news and announcements.

### Devcon

Since 2014, the Ethereum Foundation has organized Devcon, the annual conference for all Ethereum developers, researchers, thinkers, and makers.

You can access video content of conference presentations for every year since its inception at [archive.devcon.org](https://archive.devcon.org/).

Learn more at [devcon.org](https://devcon.org/) or check out the [Devcon Blog](https://blog.ethereum.org/category/devcon/) for the latest announcements.
